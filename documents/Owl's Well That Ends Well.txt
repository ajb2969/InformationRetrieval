Owl's Well That Ends Well
Season 1
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
<b>Spike</b>: Awesome!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know, this shower only happens once every 100 years.
<b>Spike</b>: A centennial celebration!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We better get a move on!
<b>Spike</b>: Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [sigh] There.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
<b>Spike</b>: Check!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Scrolls?
<b>Spike</b>: Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, 
bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker 
nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggle] I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant.
<b>Spike</b>: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That is why you are my number one assistant.
<b>Spike</b>: Missed that! Huh...?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I said... [giggle] Come on, let's get 
going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the "Astronomical 
Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy".
<b>Spike</b>: The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?
<b>Spike</b>: Right. Check! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh... Ahhhh...! [sigh] [huge sneeze]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
[ominous music]
[theme song]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
<b>Spike</b>: Well... Maybe someone borrowed it? Besides, you 
don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 
'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And a number one assistant, right?
<b>Spike</b>: Check!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [munch] [gulp] Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yes ma'am!
<b>Rarity</b>: Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, come on. [pause] I said come on.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
<b>Rarity</b>: Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
<b>Spike</b>: Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. [pause] Twilight, your turn.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, that's enough.
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, right. That's enough.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Hey, everypony! The show is starting!
[<b>Everybody</b>: Wow, that's amazing!/It's really cool./Once!]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Spike</b>: Wow...
<b>Spike</b>: [yawn] Huh?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?
<b>Spike</b>: [snoring]
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, poor little thing.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And now the punch has been... "spiked"!
[ponies laughing]
<b>Spike</b>: [snoring]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Goodnight, Spike. [giggle] Sweet 
dreams, number one assistant. [sigh] "The Study of Comets. Comets are 
small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and
 frozen gases. They..."
[creaking]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh. "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
[creaking]
[wind whistling]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo! Hoo! Hoo-hoo.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo! Hoo!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile
 and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that 
grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
<b>Spike</b>: [snoring] Huh? Waah! I overslept! I know it's 
already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work 
twice as fast! Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight! And what do you want
 for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, don't worry.
<b>Spike</b>: But my morning chores...
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
<b>Spike</b>: Who?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
<b>Spike</b>: Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, don't worry. He's just here to 
help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce 
yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.
<b>Spike</b>: Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. 
Who's worried? Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi 
there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo.
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo?
<b>Spike</b>: I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo!
<b>Spike</b>: Who?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo!
<b>Spike</b>: I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo?
<b>Spike</b>: Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever. I'm Spike,
 okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're 
number two. Got it?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo?
<b>Spike</b>: So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on 
you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know? [crash] Well, 
not really, but... You know what I mean!
[door slams]
<b>Spike</b>: That bird is out for my job. He wants to be 
number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one. Not 
Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last
 thing I do!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... <i>Hoo</i>ked!
[everybody laughs]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: He's just wonderful.
<b>Spike</b>: [mocking] "He's just wonderful." Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer.
<b>Rarity</b>: And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
<b>Spike</b>: Grrr!
<b>Applejack</b>: What's he all saddle sore about?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
<b>Spike</b>: They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight <i>and</i> Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth—
<b>Spike</b>: ...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no 
worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I 
guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland" too.
<b>Spike</b>: Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Climb down from there before you fall.
[crash]
<b>Spike</b>: Grrr!
[snap]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shoot!
<b>Spike</b>: Yes, sir!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My last writing quill. It's broken.
<b>Spike</b>: Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is 
here! [under his breath] Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... 
Quill... Quill, where is it...?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo.
<b>Spike</b>: Where am I gonna get a quill?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, wait! Wait!
<b>Spike</b>: But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things!
<b>Davenport</b>: Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa?
<b>Spike</b>: [groan]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!
<b>Spike</b>: Not a quince. A quill!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche! [pronounced phonetically]
<b>Spike</b>: Not a quiche. [pronounced correctly] A quill!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
<b>Spike</b>: [sigh] Shoot.
<b>Spike</b>: Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! 
Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here! [grunting] 
Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it!
<b>Spike</b>: [panting] Spike... to the rescue.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you 
when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one 
of his feathers to use as a quill.
<b>Spike</b>: That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll 
just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already
 do them?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
<b>Spike</b>: Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finish– [snoring]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
<b>Spike</b>: Huh?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike. What is this? You said this 
book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, 
but like this. How did it get this way?
<b>Spike</b>: Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
<b>Spike</b>: [to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game.
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo!
<b>Spike</b>: Not "who"! Two! Urgh!
<b>Spike</b>: Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?
[mouse squeaking]
<b>Spike</b>: Ah... <i>Muahahaha!</i>
<b>Rarity</b>: Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
<b>Spike</b>: So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it 
shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to 
blame. And I'll be number one... again! <i>Muhahaha!</i>
<b>Spike</b>: [evil laugh] That poor little field mouse! 
Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls 
eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be 
punished! Right?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! I don't know what upsets me 
more. That you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious or that you 
actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your 
jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is <i>not</i> the Spike I know and love.
<b>Spike</b>: She... She doesn't love me anymore.
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?
[thunder]
[rain falls]
<b>Spike</b>: I guess that's a yes. Hello? Hello?
[thunder]
<b>Spike</b>: What is that? If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!
<b>Spike</b>: [hiccup] Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me 
is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love 
me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be 
getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure 
getting hot in here.
<b>Green dragon</b>: <i>What are you doing in </i>my<i> cave? And why are you eating </i>my<i> gems?</i>
<b>Spike</b>: Heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?
<b>Green dragon</b>: [growl]
<b>Spike</b>: Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?
<b>Green dragon</b>: [roar]
<b>Spike</b>: You don't scare me! So you're big.
<b>Green dragon</b>: [growl]
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Really</i> big. And your claws are super 
sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you
 like that? Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna
 be ya! Aah!
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo-hoo!
<b>Green dragon</b>: [roar] [wail]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! Over here!
<b>Spike</b>: Am I glad to see you!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo! Hoo-hoo!
<b>Green dragon</b>: [roar]
<b>Spike</b>: [sigh]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [pants] Spike. We were so worried about you. <i>I</i> was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
<b>Spike</b>: I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but 
you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. 
It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to 
stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are 
nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. 
No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a 
jealous numbskull.
<b>Spike</b>: I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.
<b>Spike</b>: And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo?
<b>Spike</b>: Me. Forgive me, Spike.
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggle] He forgives you, Spike.
<b>Spike</b>: Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
<b>Spike</b>: Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it? Uh... [nervous giggle]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
<b>Spike</b>: I'm ready when you are.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Spike. Why don't <i>you</i> write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what <i>you've</i> learned?
<b>Spike</b>: Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i>
<i>This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will...</i> [drops asleep]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike.
<b>Owlowiscious</b>: Hoo?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Who? Spike! You kno... Ohhhh... [giggle]
