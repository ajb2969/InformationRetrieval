[Previously on My Little Pony]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..." [gasp] My brother?
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How <i>dare</i> you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
<b>Shining Armor</b>: A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance, it's me! Twilight!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [uninterested] Uh-huh.
<b>Shining Armor</b>: And I think I should wear it.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Are you disagreeing with me?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to <i>heal</i> me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: You <i>will</i> be.
[theme song]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [echoing] Hello? Is anyone there?
[thud]
[laughter]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where am I?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: <i>The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison.</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Help! Help!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [laughing] <i>It's no use. No one can hear you. And no one will ever think to look for you, either. Most ponies have forgotten that these caves even exist, which is why they are the ideal place to keep the ones who try to interfere with my plans.</i> [laughing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Plans? What plans?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: <i>The plans I have for your brother, of course.</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't you <i>dare</i> do anything to my brother, you... you monster!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: <i>Only way to stop me is to catch me!</i> [laughing] <i>Over here!</i> [laughing] <i>Nope, over here!</i> [laughing]
[glass breaking]
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! 
Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned 
like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Likely story!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves...
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Princess Cadance</b>: ...and do a little shake.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You remember me!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most?
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing]
<b>[Queen Chrysalis]</b>
This day is going to be perfect
The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
Everypony will gather 'round
Say I look lovely in my gown
What they don't know is that I have fooled them all!

<b>[Princess Cadance]</b>
This day was going to be perfect
The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
But instead of having cake
With all my friends to celebrate
My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all…

<b>[Queen Chrysalis]</b>
I could care less about the dress
I won't partake in any cake
Vows, well I'll be lying when I say

That through any kind of weather
I'll want us to be together
The truth is I don't care for him at all

No I do not love the groom
In my heart there is no room
But I still want him to be all mine

<b>[Princess Cadance]</b>
We must escape before it's too late
Find a way to save the day
Hope, I'll be lying if I say

"I don't fear that I may lose him
To one who wants to use him
Not care for, love, and cherish him each day"

For I oh so love the groom
All my thoughts he does consume
Oh, Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon

<b>[Queen Chrysalis]</b>
Finally the moment has arrived
For me to be one lucky bride

<b>[Princess Cadance]</b>
Oh, the wedding we won't make
He'll end up marrying a fake
Shining Armor will be...

<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: ...mine, all mine. [evil laugh]
[organ music]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Mares and gentlecolts, we are 
gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore 
Cadenza and Shining Armor.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Oh, we're never going to save him.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We will. We just have to find... There!
<b>Minuette</b>, <b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>, and <b>Twinkleshine</b>: You're not going anywhere.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you–
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Stop!</i>
[ponies chattering]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother? [sobbing] Why does she have to ruin my special day?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Because it's not <i>your</i> special day! It's <i>mine</i>!
[ponies gasp]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids?
<b>Minuette</b>, <b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>, and <b>Twinkleshine</b>: I want it!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late.
<b>Applejack</b>: I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.
[flames roaring]
[ponies gasp]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing] Right you are, Princess. And
 as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my 
subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. 
My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will 
gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [chuckling] Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Mm-hmm.
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to 
the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding 
off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so 
does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it.
<b>Changelings</b>: [laughing]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing] He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [gasp]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: And, I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Not my Shining Armor!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: No. You won't. You may have made it 
impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have
 so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from 
you!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [grunting]
[explosion]
[crown clatters]
[ponies gasp]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
<b>Twilight Sparkle, Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Fluttershy</b>: Rarity!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing] You can run, but you can't hide!
<b>Changelings</b>: [laughing]
[barrier breaking]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Go, go!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're changelings, remember?
<b>Changelings</b> [as <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>]: They're changelings, remember?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
[various fighting sounds]
<b>Changelings</b> [as <b>Rainbow Dash</b>]: [growls]
<b>Changeling</b>: [hisses]
<b>Applejack</b>: Okay, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughing] Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better.
[changelings buzzing]
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends will–
[doors open]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed!
[doors close]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing] It's funny, really. Twilight
 here was suspicious of my behavior all along. Too bad the rest of you 
were too caught up in your wedding planning to realize those suspicions 
were correct! [laughing]
<b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Hmm, I did, didn't I?
This day has been just perfect
The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
Everypony I'll soon control
Every stallion, mare, and foal
Who says a girl can't really have it all? [evil laugh]

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
[electric sounds]
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Wha– where... huh? Is...is the wedding over?
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: It's <i>all</i> over!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Your spell! Perform your spell!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [laughing] What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.
<b>Shining Armor</b>: No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: My love will give you strength.
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: [chuckling] What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
[magic twinkling and surging]
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b>: Noooooo!
<b>Queen Chrysalis</b> and <b>Changelings</b>: [screaming]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [gulp]
[birds chirping]
[cymbals crashing]
[birds whistling Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"]
[doors open]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Seriously, though. I get why the queen
 of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone 
as amazing as Cadance to marry you?
<b>Shining Armor</b>: I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the <i>real</i> Princess Mi Amore Cadenza–
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Princess Cadance is fine.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and
 Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of 
their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce 
you mare and colt!
[cheering]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: This is your victory as much as 
theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your
 being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. <i>Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.</i>
<b>Shining Armor</b> and <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [kissing]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.
[explosion]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Best... wedding... ever!
["Love Is In Bloom" starting]
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [squee] Let's get this party started!
<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>
Love is in bloom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom,
Two hearts becoming one
A bond that cannot be undone because

Love is in bloom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said love is in bloom
You're starting a life and making room
For us (For us, For us....)

<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Ready to go?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Oh! Almost forgot.
<b>Rarity</b>: IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b> [background]
Love is in bloom
A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
I said love is in bloom
You're starting a life and making room
For us, (For us... For us... Aah...)

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now <i>this</i> was a great wedding.
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, yeah? Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party! [laughing]
<b>Everypony</b>: [laughing]
