[ponies chattering] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville. 
<b>Snails</b>: I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash. 
[ponies agreeing] 
<b>Snips</b>: I object! 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Snips</b>: I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most  <i>stupendous</i> pony! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: 'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic! 
<b>Snips</b>: Astonishing! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Breathtaking! 
<b>Snips</b>: Astounding! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Bedazzling! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing? 
[ponies agreeing] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'! 
<b>Fan club</b>: Aye! [cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [giggles] <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed. 
<b>Aura</b>: Help! Help! Help! Help! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal. 
<b>Aura</b>: To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: That Rainbow Dash sure is something. 
<b>Snips</b> and  <b>Snails</b>: Something special. <b>"Millie"</b>: [screams] 
<b>Cream Puff</b>: [crying] 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby! 
[crowd gasps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash! 
[ponies cheering] 
[cameras clicking] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can think of a few new words. 
<b>Applejack</b>: And I bet 'modest' is not one of them. 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, but she is kinda awesome. [elderly ponies chattering] 
[splintering wood] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here! 
[elderly ponies screaming] 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Pony 1</b>: We'd be lost without you! 
<b>Pony 2</b>: You're our hero, Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Crowd</b>: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't hear you! 
<b>Crowd</b>: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You may be right...silly. <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day. 
<b>Spike</b>: That day. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely  <i>arrogant</i> ever since. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hm. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be  <i>immortalized</i> as my friend? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Immorta-what? 
[camera clicking] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Are you taking notes? 
<b>Spike</b>: Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written  <i>by</i> the pony they are about. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm  <i>far</i> too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [yelps] Spike's a ghost! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike? 
<b>Spike</b>: Don't... you... Spike. Got it! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge. <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunts] There you go. 
<b>"Lemon Daze"</b>: Someday, I wanna be just like you! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible. 
<b>Cherry Berry</b>: [screams] 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Cherry Berry</b>: Help! Help! 
<b>Snips</b>: Uh, don't you think you should go and help? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more. 
<b>Spike</b>: The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time? 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Pony</b>: Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere! 
<b>Daisy</b>: I've never seen such bravery in all my life! 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mare Do Well, huh? Well that  <i>mare</i> would  <i>do well</i> to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me! [ponies screaming] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow– 
<b>Globe Trotter</b>: Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>"Wisp"</b>: Oh, thank you, Mare Do We– e... 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than  <i>me?</i> Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the  <i>hard</i> way. [jackhammer and drills] 
<b>Crafty Crate</b>: Huh? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor– Whoa! 
[building creaking] 
[crashing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Never fear– Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa! 
<b>Jack Hammer</b>: Look! 
<b>Crafty Crate</b>: [cheers] 
<b>"Jim Beam"</b>: Look out for the– Watch out for falling– On your left! Agh! Your other left! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here ya go, safe and sound. 
[crash] 
<b>"Jim Beam"</b>: [faints] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do  <i>Slow</i>? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning. 
<b>"Rivet"</b>: Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game. [water rushing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy. 
[stone cracking] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself– [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank– You  <i>gotta</i> be kidding me... 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile,  <i>and</i> she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with  <i>that</i>? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, for the love of Pete. <b>Applejack</b>: Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: She really cares about everypony's safety. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Have you  <i>seen</i> her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion. 
<b>Applejack</b>:  <i>And</i> she's modest  <i>and</i> humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I  <i>don't</i> have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great! 
<b>Spike</b>: She's... great. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I didn't say that. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds like somepony's jealous. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who, me? 
<b>Spike</b>: Rainbow Dash is jealous. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't write that, Spike! 
[others laughing] 
<b>Spike</b>: Correction: Rainbow Dash is  <i>very</i> jealous. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good– no, that I'm a  <i>better</i> hero than Mare Do Well! <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Buses and baby carriages are  <i>always</i> careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Eh, what's that? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [panicked grunts] Back off! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition,  <i>don't you think</i>? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place! [complaining and squeaking] 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: [grunting] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Somepony's in trouble! 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: [grunting] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back! 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: Oh, brother. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [cracks neck] [grunting] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ta-da! 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: Uh... thanks. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing? 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: Aren't you milking this a bit? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing? 
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly– 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, look! 
[lawnmower rattling] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass! 
<b>"Pine Breeze"</b>: From what? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn! 
<b>Liza Doolots</b>: Lame... 
<b>Pony</b>: Whatever. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aww, who am I kidding? [thundercloud rumbles throughout] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about  <i>me</i>? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome.  <i>They're</i> wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Mistake? What mistake? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wait a minute. Why are you here? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I  <i>love</i> being alone. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, okay. See you later then. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah,  <i>right,</i> like I'm gonna thank  <i>her.</i> [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e– [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up! <b>Mayor Mare</b>: Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well! 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh? 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask! 
<b>Mare Do Well</b>: [whistles] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What the hay? 
<b>Mare Do Well</b>: [whistles] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p-  <i>Pinkie</i>?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh-  <i>huh</i>?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were  <i>three</i> of you?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times. 
<b>Applejack</b>:  <i>I</i> stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. [twitches] 
[flowerpot shatters] 
<b>Cherry Berry</b>: Sorry! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's alright. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And  <i>I</i> used my magic to fix the dam. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards. 
<b>Rarity</b>:  <i>I</i> made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't understand.  <i>Why?</i> Don't you want me to be a hero? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of  <i>course</i> we want you to be a hero. 
<b>Applejack</b>: But a  <i>real</i> hero doesn't brag. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little. 
<b>Other main cast</b>: A little?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, a lot. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But... 
<b>Applejack</b>: ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. [slurp] 
<b>Applejack</b>: I think we're getting off topic here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What we're trying to say is,  <i>it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.</i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ohhhh. That makes  <i>loads</i> more sense. Yeah. You're right.  <i>And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me.</i> Like Mare Do Well. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia. 
<b>Spike</b>: Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself. 
<b>Spike</b>: Aww,  <i>come on</i>, I wrote the whole thing already! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, let's hear it. 
<b>Spike</b>: [clears throat]  <i>Dear Princess Cel</i>- 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look out! It's a  <i>real</i> ghost! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Spike</b>: [yelping and screaming] 
<b>Others</b>: [laughing] [music]
