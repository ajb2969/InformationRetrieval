Party Pooped
Season 5
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ohhhh...
<b>Fluttershy</b>: They're probably just as nervous as you are.
<b>Applejack</b>: You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales] [exhales] You're right. 
Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for 
hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal 
Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess 
Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! 
[nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm...
<b>Spike</b>: [blows trumpet]
[carpet unfurling]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Ponies! Greetings, ponies!
[teleporting zap]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks. [echoing] <i>Friends for a thousand moons!</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You must be hungry after a long journey.
[table scraping]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gulp]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: [sniffs] [chewing] [spits] This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring]
[assorted noises of destruction]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Is it okay to be nervous <i>now</i>?
[theme song]
[walls cracking]
<b>Applejack</b>: Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' "howdy."
<b>Rarity</b>: They're different, that's all. Very... different.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All we have to do is show them how 
great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the
 friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed 
history of Yakyakistan I recommended?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um... I-I had a thing...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I did, I did! Did you know they live so far 
north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time? Yaks have yak 
fur to keep them warm. [squee]
<b>Applejack</b>: Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know! Yaks are so cool!
[vase smashing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, can you show them around 
town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would 
really help make them feel welcome.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Remember, we want to make sure 
Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make 
this place feel like Yakyakistan.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No problem!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!
<b>Main cast sans Twilight</b>: [cries of agreement]
<b>Applejack</b>: We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the
 so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you 
rested here in the barn during your visit.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Hmm... This perfect.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!
<b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] That wasn't so hard.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Wait! This not yak hay!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, we didn't have <i>actual</i> hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Not perfect! Yaks destroy!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring and grunting]
<b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!
[animals chittering]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Animals cute.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh. Thank goodness.
[thud]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! <i>Yaks smash!</i>
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring and grunting]
[teaware shattering]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think.
<b>Rarity</b>: Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. 
Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern 
sensibilities. I hope you'll find them—
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [chewing]
<b>Rarity</b>: ...delicious.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [spits]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: This no taste like yak fabric! <i>Yaks destroy!</i>
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring and grunting]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow.
[birds tweeting]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Hold your frown, face!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hit it, Rainbow Dash!
[snow booming]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: [slurp] This not yak snow!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring and grunting]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Seriously?! ...Seriously?
<b>Applejack</b>: Y'know... it's goin' okay.
<b>Rarity</b>: Satisfactory, I'd say.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It could be better.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [whispering] It's not very good.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>It's a disaster!</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan 
theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all 
about this afternoon, right? Because if it's <i>not</i> perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I definitely will! I think. Maybe...?
<b>Applejack</b>: You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You'll show 'em a good time!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You can do it!
<b>Rarity</b>: We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Why are your eyes darting around like that?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's what I do when I'm not nervous! [laughing hysterically]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you—
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me either! Gotta go!
[hoofsteps trailing off]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [hyperventilating] Gummy, what am I gonna do?
 I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna 
hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're
 just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! <i>Fluttershy!</i> 
Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make 
this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and 
bringing something back?!
<b>Gummy</b>: [slurps]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Gummy, you're a genius. [kisses]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Vanilla extract balance very tricky.
<b>Yaks</b>: Uh-huh.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?
[teleporting zap]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [teeth chattering] Did you find her?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Angel and I searched the forest, but...
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aerial recon turned up nothing either.
<b>Applejack</b>: I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie
 Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, 
so... not a complete loss.
<b>Rarity</b>: She's simply vanished!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?!
[whack]
<b>Gummy</b>: [barfs]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Don't worry. I'll be back 
in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie." If Pinkie Pie says she'll be 
back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right?
 [nervous laugh] No reason to <i>freak out!</i>
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Don't worry, Twilight.
<b>Applejack</b>: When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Piece o' cake.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>The cake!</i>
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan. [nervous laugh] I hope.
[teleporting zap]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: [chewing] Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [roaring and grunting]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've never needed a party so badly.
<b>Conductor</b>: Next stop, Crystal Empire!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And so my quest begins. I know what you're 
thinking. "Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?" Because I'm the 
party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want
 a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire,
 find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I 
mean?
[brakes screeching and hissing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the 
snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow. [spits] Nope. 
Sand. Definitely sand.
<b>Conductor</b>: Dodge City. End of the line, I'm afraid. All trains had to stop. Sheep decided to sit on the tracks.
[sheep baaing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Curse you, sheep!</i> Thanks for you help, conductor.
[smack]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Cherry Jubilee!
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: Pinkie Pie?! I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: How are you? You look amazing! I need help.
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda. What can I do ya for?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there?
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this 
right here's your lucky day! I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire 
myself for a delivery. I ought to warn you though – me and the boys are 
powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries. Hey there! 
Wake up!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Counting cherries? How many?
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four. Yee-haw!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And so my quest resumes. As I stare across 
the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the 
homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best 
party they've ever seen. Know what I mean?
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: [snoring]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Cherry? Ravine. Ravine!
[alarm clock ringing]
[water splashing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wake up! Wake up! [grunting] <i>Stooooop!</i>
[screeching]
[thuds]
<b>Cherry Jubilee</b>: Huh?! [gasps] Whoa. I was dreamin' about a ravine. <i>Ravine!</i>
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's what I said.
[rock cracks, snaps]
[piano playing]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b> and <b>Yaks</b>: [sobbing]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Music beautiful. Much soul.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Phew!
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] When Twilight told me to stall— I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could—
[piano continues playing]
<b>Yaks</b>: Huh?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Piano play itself?! Music a lie! [roars]
[piano smashing]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! Just a little longer!
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare <i>war</i>!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasps]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!
<b>Applejack</b>: Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's sort of panic-themed.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The yaks are going home! This is 
awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is 
that I may have just started a war.
[wind blowing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... <i>Pow!</i>
 We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a 
ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here
 and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences 
tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my 
journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I
 am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what
 I mean?
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: This is it. The northern boundary of 
the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this
 climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I do.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Good luck, Pinkie Pie.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm sure she's trying her best.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know you're right, but... I wish she
 was here. I put too much pressure on her. I let everypony down. And 
Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made 
new friends. I've made new enemies. [sighs]
[gears clicking]
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie</b>: [screaming]
[snow shuffling]
[creature roaring]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it?
<b>Monster</b>: [roaring]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're saying—
<b>Monster</b>: [growling]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [yelps] There it is! Yakyakistan!
[sledding]
[gate opens]
[snow cracks, breaks]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Noooooooooo...!</i> [fades in and out]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh. Is everypony alright?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think I can see a little bit.
[crash]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Gah! Nope.
[light flickers on]
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie</b>: Ooooh...
<b>Applejack</b>: Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: With exactly what kind of parties we like.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [reading] "Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..."
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's right!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: "But she's afraid of quesadillas."
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [fading in] <i>...oooooooo!</i> No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was <i>this</i> close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down.
[muffled chatter]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hmm?
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie</b>: [talking over each other]
<b>Applejack</b>: Looky here. It's notes for the party she 
wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't 
nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. 
And their five-hundredth?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She may be more organized than <i>you</i>, Twilight.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Let's not get carried away.
<b>Rarity</b>: I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [tearing up] Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're back!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could 
bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a 
mistake. [sighs] I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But 
I'm still just a big failure.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: What matters is how hard you tried.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan <i>one</i> party?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You know... the trip <i>was</i> really hard.
 But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks 
could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is! 
[gasps] I just got the best party idea ever!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Um, no, they didn't. [squeals] Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there!
[sloop]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: So, um, do we walk back up the slide or... or what?
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Yaks stuck here?! Why trains not work?! [growling]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!
<b>Yaks</b>: Ooh.
[ponies chattering]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: [laughing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What can I say? I'm good at what I do. 
Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria 
feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my
 adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria 
feel like <i>your</i> home. We should try to make you feel <i>at home in Equestria</i>. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Ponies and yaks... friends?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: For a thousand moons?
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: <i>For a thousand moons!</i>
<b>Mane Six</b>, <b>Princess Celestia</b>, and <b>Yaks</b>: [cheering]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: I am very impressed, princess.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: And you did a wonderful job of it. You <i>and</i> your friends.
<b>Prince Rutherford</b>: Pink pony, you understand yaks now.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, come here, you!
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [strained] Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay!
