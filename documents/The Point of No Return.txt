<b>Spike</b>: Whoa! 
[thud!] 
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight, mail's here! 
[doors opening] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] 
[squeak] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Are you all right? 
<b>Derpy</b>: We just had a really heavy delivery today. 
<b>Spike</b>: Is it a deluxe set of special edition  <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i> figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever? 
<b>Derpy</b>: Well, it's for Twilight. 
<b>Spike</b>: Awww... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you. 
<b>Derpy</b>: You're welcome! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh. It's from Princess Celestia. 
<b>Spike</b>: [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this? It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a filly! 
<b>Spike</b>: [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls!  <i>And</i> here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true! 
<b>Spike</b>: Is my  <i>Smash Fortune</i> comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa! 
[thud] 
<b>Spike</b>: [muffled] Or this. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, no! Oh, no!  <i>Oh, no!</i> 
<b>Spike</b>: What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record! 
<b>Spike</b>: [clears throat]  <i>Had</i> a perfect record. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] I've never turned in a book even a  <i>minute</i> late! And  <i>this</i> one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville! [stamping] 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I promise I won't let you down! 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle. After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oooh! I hope I do forever! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of  <i>Predictions and Prophecies</i>. What's that for? 
<b>Spike</b>: Well, it  <i>was</i> a gift for Moon Dancer, but... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville, and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself! 
<b>Spike</b>: I take it we're going to Canterlot? 
[zip!] 
<b>Spike</b>: [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] 
[leaves rustling] 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes. But what if somepony sees me in there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof. 
<b>Spike</b>: [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A late book is a big deal, Spike. What if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering the building again?! 
<b>Spike</b>: Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell! 
<b>Spike</b>: You sniff books? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You  <i>don't?</i> I used to  <i>live</i> in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess  <i>am</i> I? 
<b>Spike</b>: One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously] 
<b>Spike</b>: [groans] [teleportation zaps] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return. 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: Princess Twilight! So good to see you! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: Need some recommendations from the new release section? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's  <i>Seven Theories on Bending Time</i>? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks! 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter. 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: Dusty who? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever. 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervous giggle] 
<b>Spike</b>: [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs] Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out this long will probably cost a thousand bits! 
<b>Spike</b>: She— I mean,  <i>we</i> have an overdue book. 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time. 
<b>Spike</b>: See? 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: I'll just find it in the card catalog. Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for Ponies Who Should Know Better. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't pull any punches with those names, do you? 
<b>Spike</b>: And that office would be...? 
<b>Librarian Pony</b>: In the basement. [whispering] Because of the  <i>shame</i>. 
[thud] <b>Spike</b>: Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds! 
<b>Spike</b>:  <i>And</i> faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"? 
<b>Spike</b>: [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No! I can't wait another minute to return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch! 
<b>Spike</b>: Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips] 
[beat] 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies. 
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits! 
<b>Spike</b>: [mock-sobbing] 
<b>Pretzel</b>: Waiter, we're ready to order. 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, uh, I'm not actually— 
<b>Pretzel</b>: Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us? 
<b>Spike</b>: Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table? 
<b>Pretzel</b>: Sounds great. 
<b>Moon Dancer</b>: Twilight? Is that you? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh. 
<b>Moon Dancer</b>: Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you. 
<b>First Folio</b>: Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that. 
<b>Moon Dancer</b>: Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-mm. 
<b>First Folio</b>: Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait. Forced to leave? 
<b>First Folio</b>: Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all. 
<b>Moon Dancer</b>: Are you okay, Twilight? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me? 
[whoosh] 
[spinning] 
<b>Spike</b>: That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because  <i>I</i> didn't return this book! Spike, I think  <i>I</i> got her fired! [brake skids] 
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight, the library is  <i>that</i> way! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time. 
<b>Spike</b>: But what about your late fees? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're not as important as making things right. 
<b>Spike</b>: Wait. So you're  <i>not</i> going to return the book? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back. It'll fix everything! [sighs] 
[knocking] 
[door opens] 
<b>Meathead Pony</b>: Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I'm not selling anything. 
<b>Meathead Pony</b>: No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature... 
[thud] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house. 
<b>Meathead Pony</b>: Dusty Pages? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes! 
<b>Meathead Pony</b>: Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this. 
[thud] 
<b>Meathead Pony</b>: It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to  <i>change her address!</i> 
[door slams] [montage music] 
[knocking] [squeaking] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years." This has to be it! 
<b>Spike</b>: I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked. 
[door opens] 
<b>Spike</b>: [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is— 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight! 
<b>Sand Trap</b>: [snoring] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me! 
<b>"Teddie Safari"</b>: Yes, how may I help you? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages? 
<b>"Teddie Safari"</b>: Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe that  <i>my</i> carelessness sent her  <i>here</i>, when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books! 
<b>Spike</b>: You realize that might just be a you thing, right? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales] 
[knocking] 
[long pause] 
[watch ticking] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] 
<b>Spike</b>: She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. We are fixing this  <i>now</i>. This place isn't that big. We can find her. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry to interrupt your  <i>plein air</i> painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her? 
<b>Apple Rose</b>: Sure have! 
[beat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] And...? 
<b>Apple Rose</b>: She had to leave early to get to her  <i>fengbi de ti</i> session. 
<b>Old Stallion</b>: Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing. 
<b>Apple Rose</b>: Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again. 
<b>Old Stallion</b>: Then there's her band practice later. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you! 
<b>Spike</b>: Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long! [montage music] 
[gate swinging] [teleportation zap] 
[hammer tapping] 
[door shuts and opens] [splash] 
[more splashes] [door opens] [door opens] 
[band playing music] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike! 
<b>Spike</b>: Wait. She looks pretty happy up there. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library! 
[music abruptly stops] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Care to take five, everypony? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been looking all over Equestria for you! 
[thud] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I need to tell you something. 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right. 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: I don't remember you doing anything wrong. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back! 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: [gasps] It was  <i>you</i> that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back! 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be. [band playing music] 
<b>Spike</b>: [snapping fingers] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Do you mind? 
[music pauses, continues softly] 
<b>Spike</b>: [slurping] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't understand. If Dusty Pages won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain imperfect! 
<b>Spike</b>: And yours will, too? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more! 
<b>Spike</b>: [dryly] Really? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?! 
[abacus clicking] 
<b>Spike</b>: Uhhh... you don't wanna know. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] It would've been worth all the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I knew why she won't go back! 
<b>Spike</b>: Why don't you ask her? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She didn't seem to want to talk. 
<b>Spike</b>: You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got to lose? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now that I've messed up this much? Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she went? Crochet? Bingo? [splat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?! 
[splats] 
<b>Spike</b>: Hey, everypony! We come in— 
[splat] 
<b>Spike</b>: Eh, pieces. 
[splats] 
[teleportation zap] 
[splats] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>:  <i>Time out!</i> [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear. 
<b>Spike</b>: We're not actually here for the game. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book. 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if that's what it takes. 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: [laughs] 
<b>Spike</b>: That is not the reaction we expected. 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're not? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me. 
[tapping] 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: All those years I spent hiding away in that library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt something exhilarating! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What was it? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Freedom. 
<b>Spike</b>: From books? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: From perfection! I was too stubborn to know when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I wasn't living the life I wanted! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you  <i>wanted</i> to? 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Twilight, your late book was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it right! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back? 
[splat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [strangled scream] 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But it'll have a stain! 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't. 
[splat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Perfection". 
<b>Dusty Pages</b>: And the next part? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit". 
<b>Spike</b> and  <b>Dusty Pages</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier. <b>First Folio</b>: Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan? 
<b>First Folio</b>: Twenty-eight bits. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and  <b>Spike</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Spike</b>: That's  <i>it</i>?! 
<b>First Folio</b>: Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts] 
[bits clinking] 
<b>First Folio</b>: Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Um, is that  <i>really</i> necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all. 
<b>Spike</b>: [clears throat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you? 
<b>First Folio</b>: No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy. 
<b>Spike</b>: In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around. 
<b>First Folio</b>: You sure? It's got a stain. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's what makes it perfect. [credits]
