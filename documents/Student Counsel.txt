Student Counsel
Season 9
<b>Trixie</b>: I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh! Speaking of...
[teleportation zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: [sighs, blows, sips]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh. One sec.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: [sips]
[spoon clattering]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What was I saying? Oh, right. Being 
able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students
 feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
<b>Trixie</b>: Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the 
work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time 
with you.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
<b>Trixie</b>: Well...
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chewing]
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [mouth full] Hold that thought.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: [growls, chomps]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the 
door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. 
Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you
 were saying?
<b>Trixie</b>: [sips]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs nervously]
[theme song]
<b>Silverstream</b>: I totally respect my younger cousins' 
decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. 
Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research 
assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree 
Forest! How would <i>you</i> describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
<b>Silverstream</b>: I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
<b>Silverstream</b>: "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
<b>Trixie</b>: Except for today, of course.
[door closes]
<b>Student Pony</b>: [whimpers]
<b>Trixie</b>: If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost 
spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the
 spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any 
issues before <i>they</i> head home for the holiday.
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
[door closes]
<b>Trixie</b>: I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!
[beat]
<b>Trixie</b>: The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?
[beat]
<b>Trixie</b>: Sunburst is coming to town?
[beat]
<b>Trixie</b>: You and I promised to make the cake?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
<b>Trixie</b>: [low growl]
[door closes]
<b>Trixie</b>: Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I 
shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my 
students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have
 to do.
<b>Trixie</b>: Good!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Great!
[beat]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So... what <i>are</i> all the things we have to do?
<b>Trixie</b>: [whines] Maud needs streamers for the 
decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian 
spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Of course he does.
<b>Trixie</b>: Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were <i>both</i> looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
<b>Trixie</b>: We could... but then we'd miss out on baking <i>together</i>. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to <i>make</i> a cake, not <i>buy</i> a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie <i>keeps her promises!</i>
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: —get started on those sticks, and 
I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang 
on to this? Don't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care 
of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!
[teleportation zap]
<b>Rose</b>: Could it be plum blossom?
<b>Trixie</b>: I have no idea.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: [yelps]
[thud]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
<b>Trixie</b>: I thought <i>I</i> was getting the flowering sticks.
<b>Rose</b>: Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
<b>Trixie</b>: No one is.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: —riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]
[teleportation zap]
[glue squirting]
<b>Silverstream</b>: I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.
[bracelet chiming]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was <i>my</i> job! I think. Wait. Was it?
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
[teleportation zap]
[transformation zaps]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but—
<b>Silverstream</b>: Counselor Starlight!
[door opens]
<b>Silverstream</b>: When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word "dry". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.
[door closes]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wait, Mrs. Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful
 Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight 
sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single 
thing.
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.
[bracelet chiming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Of course it is.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
[click]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie? What are you doing here?
<b>Trixie</b>: It's the one place I knew I could find you.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I am so sorry about today. I'm just so—
<b>Trixie</b>: Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's not—!
[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
[door opens]
<b>Silverstream</b>: Starlight, you have a minute?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time <i>you</i>
 caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you 
can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, 
the counselor's office is closed.
[door closes]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I have a cake to bake.
[clatter]
<b>Sunburst</b>: Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
<b>Trixie</b>: [growls]
<b>Sunburst</b>: I mean, it looks really... interesting?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
<b>Trixie</b>: [growls]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
<b>Trixie</b>: And with all of your students home for the 
holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office 
in the middle of it.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
<b>Terramar</b>: Hello?! Starlight?!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [spits]
<b>Terramar</b>: Starlight?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
<b>Terramar</b>: Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What's wrong?
<b>Terramar</b>: I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
<b>Trixie</b>: [chewing]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
<b>Terramar</b>: Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
<b>Sunburst</b>: It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
<b>Terramar</b>: Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs 
and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. 
They sent me to check the school.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
<b>Terramar</b>: Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: She never told me about a project.
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?
<b>Trixie</b>: [short laugh]
<b>Terramar</b>: What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
<b>Trixie</b>: The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean <i>always</i>.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Except apparently when it matters. 
This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will 
check the school. We'll find your sister.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.
[beat]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: But that's probably not important.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.
[doors open]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Silverstream?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [echoing] Hello?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zaps]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Anycreature?!
[splash]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Terramar</b>: [panting] She's not down here.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't see her anywhere.
<b>Terramar</b>: Did you check her room?
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, she's not here.
<b>Terramar</b>: No, she isn't. But look at this.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: A cockatrice?
<b>Terramar</b>: Could that be what her project was on? You 
don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by 
herself, do you?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs nervously]
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>All</b>: [yelps]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What are you all doing here?
<b>Sunburst</b>: We came to help.
<b>Trixie</b>: We couldn't let you handle this alone.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, she wasn't alone.
[beat]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: But we wanted to help anyway.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Thanks. All of you. But the students are <i>my</i> responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
<b>Trixie</b>: I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But I don't want to ruin your party.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
<b>Terramar</b>: Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
<b>Trixie</b> and <b>Sunburst</b>: [gasp]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
<b>Sunburst</b>: What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! <i>And</i> the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
<b>Trixie</b>: I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!
[zip!]
[tense music]
<b>Trixie</b>: The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!
<b>Trixie</b>: This way!
<b>Trixie</b>: [sniffs]
[wind whistling]
[owl hoots]
<b>Trixie</b>: [slurp, chews, spits]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Weren't we just here?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
<b>Trixie</b>: No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
<b>Sunburst</b>: We might need a more concrete plan.
<b>Trixie</b>: Hmph. Suit yourself.
<b>Terramar</b>: Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
<b>Trixie</b>: Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find <i>that</i> in a forest.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris <i>can</i> grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You complete me.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: There's some pine trees over there!
[cockatrices clucking and hissing]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
<b>Sunburst</b>: [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
<b>Terramar</b>: [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
<b>Trixie</b>: [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
[cockatrice hisses]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically—
<b>Trixie</b>: [whispering] Don't even say it!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
<b>Terramar</b>: [whispering] So what do we do?
[cockatrices hiss]
<b>Sunburst</b>: <i>Ruuuuun!</i>
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices squawk]
<b>Sunburst</b>: [screaming]
[thud]
<b>Sunburst</b>: [groans, babbles] 
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Sunburst!
[magic zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Sunburst</b>: Aah!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Stop! It's me!
<b>Sunburst</b>: Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I know. Hang on.
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.
[teleportation zap]
<b>Sunburst</b>: Be careful!
[clucking and hissing]
<b>Terramar</b>: The clucking is coming from everywhere!
<b>Trixie</b>: The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!
[poof!]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Come on!
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Sunburst</b>: Aah!
[teleportation zap]
[cockatrices hiss]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Maud! We've got to get out of here!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
[teleportation zap]
[teleportation zap]
<b>Trixie</b>, <b>Sunburst</b>, and <b>Terramar</b>: [gasps]
<b>Sunburst</b>: Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.
<b>Trixie</b>: We've got to get out of here!
<b>Terramar</b>: But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!
[cockatrices hiss]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, we can't stay here! Come on!
[cockatrices hissing]
[leaves rustling]
[cockatrice clucks]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [screams]
[cockatrices hissing]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This way!
[cockatrices hiss]
[doors open]
[doors close]
[thudding]
<b>Trixie</b>: Now what?!
<b>Sunburst</b>: Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to 
hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this 
really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
<b>Terramar</b>: Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] This <i>is</i> all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
<b>Trixie</b>: That seems a little extreme.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a
 holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and 
you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, 
we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, <i>and</i> Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
<b>Trixie</b>: Has that always been there?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? Oh, that's the students' 
treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of 
course! That should've been the first place we looked!
[scraping]
[door opens]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Counselor Starlight, no!
<b>Edith</b>: [hisses]
<b>Silverstream</b>: Wait!
[magic humming]
<b>Edith</b>: [clucking softly]
<b>Silverstream</b>: This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I... don't understand.
<b>Silverstream</b>: After you encouraged me to solve my own 
problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I 
could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, 
so I came here.
<b>Terramar</b>: Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith 
volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are 
really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
<b>Edith</b>: [clucking softly]
<b>Sunburst</b>: I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
<b>Silverstream</b>: They are really fascinating creatures. Did
 you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you 
imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I have a few ideas.
<b>Silverstream</b>: [gasps]
<b>Silverstream</b>: I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
<b>Sunburst</b>: [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, I will always be a stick pony. 
But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the 
density and permanence of rock.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Swoon.
<b>Terramar</b>: Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
<b>Trixie</b>: Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
<b>Sunburst</b>: You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm not so sure.
<b>Silverstream</b>: I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
<b>Trixie</b>: Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you <i>really</i> need to talk about?
<b>Silverstream</b>: To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah— Wait, what?!
<b>Trixie</b>: Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous—?
[clang!]
<b>Sunburst</b>: Petrified dessert?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You had me at "petrified".
<b>All except Maud Pie</b>: [laughing]
