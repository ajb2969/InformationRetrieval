<b>Scootaloo</b>: No, we've tried everything!

<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Now, that's more like it! 
<b>Pipsqueak</b>: Cutie Mark Crusaders!  <i>Help!</i> 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: What's wrong, Pipsqueak? 
<b>Pipsqueak</b>: I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders? 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Yeah! Hoof! <b>Apple Bloom</b>: [loudly] So, Pip, how would  <i>you</i> help the school if  <i>you</i> were elected student pony president? 
<b>Pipsqueak</b>: Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek! 
[snap, thump] 
<b>Pipsqueak</b>: If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong! 
[foals cheering] 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Well,  <i>I</i> think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old  <i>schoolhouse</i> window. But you all know voting for  <i>me</i> was the best choice because  <i>I</i> convinced the school board to give that window  <i>visual appeal</i>! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: 'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board. 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: [through gritted teeth]  <i>Silver Spoon!</i> That was  <i>my</i> big announcement for when  <i>I</i> won! 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: I was only trying to help. 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: [through gritted teeth] I don't  <i>need that kind of help!</i> 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Do we really need a big statue of her? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Especially where our playground equipment should be? 
[foals shocked whispering] 
<b>Pipsqueak</b>: A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for  <i>more</i> Diamond Tiara!

<b>Spoiled Rich</b>: Diamond Tiara! Why are you making that face?  <i>That</i> is not the face of a  <i>winner</i>.

<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Sorry mother.

<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We are?! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But... you've done that, right? 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Yeah, 'cause I  <i>have</i> my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at  <i>all</i> to figure out  <i>who</i> I'm supposed to be and  <i>what</i> I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!

<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Were you trying to get your cutie mark in  <i>spying</i>? Is  <i>that</i> on your little  <i>chart</i>? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you...

<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Don't worry, Pip! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: We'll meet you back at school.

<b>Pipsqueak</b>: Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!
