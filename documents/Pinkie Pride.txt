<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A cheesy sense? Ah! Double amazing! I have a Pinkie Sense! 
<b>Cheese Sandwich</b>: Yes. I sensed you did. And I happen to be the premiere party planner in all of Equestria. If there's a party in need, there I'll be. Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny, or shindig, I'm your pony. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?! What can be more perfect?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'll tell you what -- making this party epic! 'Cause this isn't just 
 <i>any</i> birthday. It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville! 
<b>Rarity</b>: Good heavens, Rainbow Dash. It's your "birth-iversary"!

<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, I don't think so. I 
 <i>know</i> so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!

<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [gasps]

<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: She actually 
 <i>has</i> a goof off rulebook? 
<b>Spike</b>: Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything! 
<b>Matilda</b>: Shhh. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down. 
[tuba sounds] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, 
 <i>you</i> are the judge. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready?
