<b>Applejack</b>: Can you believe the new baby is finally here? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud! 
<b>Rarity</b>: I wonder if it's a filly or a colt? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Meet our son, Pound Cake. 
<b>Pound Cake</b>: [yawns] 
<b>Main cast</b>: Awwww. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: ... <i>and</i> our daughter, Pumpkin Cake. 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [yawns] 
<b>Main cast</b>: Huh? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Two new foals for me to play with? [gasps] That's two, two, two times the fun!  <i>This is the greatest day ever</i>! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo! 
<b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.

<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [quieter] Happy happy birthday to you and you today– 
[thud] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn? 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Easy. My great-great-great-great grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And be careful around Pumpkin Cake. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all! 
<b>Nurse Redheart</b>: Shhh! <b>Pound Cake</b> and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [happy gurgling] <b>[Pinkie Pie]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   Happy month-i-versary to you and you today!   </dd>  <dd>   <i>[very quickly]</i> I-can't-believe-you're-already-a-month-old.

<b>Mr. Cake</b>: [chuckles] No, y'see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped. 
<b>Pound Cake</b> and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [belches] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again? 
<b>Pound Cake</b> and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [excited giggling] 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Except food. 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: [gasps] Food! Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, you just fed them bottles, remember? 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Not the babies' food! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Gh! The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: I wonder who would be available on such short notice. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me! Me! Pick me! <b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me, are you?  <i>Please don't be mad at me</i>! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'll do it! Pick me! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my  <i>other</i> reports to the Princess.

<b>Mr. Cake</b>: [groans] [unenthusiastically] Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule. [doors bang] 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggles] 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie. 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: But this time you need to  <i>take care of them</i>, not just play with them. You have to be responsible. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes, I know. I will. I am. 
[ding] 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa! That's a lot of responsi– Consider it done. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: [to Mrs. Cake] We'll frost it when we get there! C'mon, sugarplum, tick-tick!

[ba-dum tish] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Get it? Tractors that small? [pause] The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him! 
[ba-dum tish]

<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! Thank goodness they're home! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy. 
[ba-dum tish] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ex- <i>cuse</i> me? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my  <i>responsibilities</i> here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm happy to help! It's no trouble– 
[door slams] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, of all the– She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I  <i>can</i> handle things on my own! <b>Pound Cake</b>: [happy burbling] 
[toy squeaking] 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling and numing] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is  <i>not</i> a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister! 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant! 
[toy squeaks] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So,  <i>fall asleep</i>! 
<b>Pound Cake</b> and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [snoring] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight. 
[toy squeaks] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Now that's what I call handling things. [gasps] <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are! 
[toy squeaks] 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeaks toy] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!

[ploof] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Y'know, you're right. That  <i>is</i> funny. <b>Pound Cake</b>: [snoring] 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sleepy mumbling] <b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>Dear Princess Celestia,</i> 
<i>I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.</i> [bell rings] 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Pinkie Pie! We're back! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: How did everything go? [gasps] 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Are we in the right place? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Shhh! 
<b>Pound Cake</b>: [snoring] 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sleepy mumbling] 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: P-Pinkie. This is just... just... 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never! 
<b>Pound Cake</b> and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [sighs] 
<b>Pound Cake</b>: Pinkie... 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: Pie... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday. [music]
