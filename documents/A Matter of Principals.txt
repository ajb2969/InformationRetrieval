[chest opens]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Who can tell me what these are?
<b>Sandbar</b>: Whoa...
<b>Gallus</b>: Me likey...
<b>Yona</b>: Shiny!
<b>Smolder</b>: Treasure?
<b>Ocellus</b>: Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
[beat]
<b>Ocellus</b>: Heh-heh. I've read ahead in <i>Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie: Volume Seven</i>.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're right, Ocellus. This is the 
Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown 
of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak.
<b>Spike</b>: And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia gifted these to our 
school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come 
from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!
[beat]
<b>Smolder</b>: [aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?
<b>Sandbar</b>: Eh.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.
<b>Spike</b>: The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggles]
<b>Silverstream</b>: [excited squeal] Learning <i>and</i> fun?! Does it get any better than that?!
<b>Gallus</b>: You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!
<b>Students</b>: [gasp]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? They'll make a great team.
[cutie mark glowing]
<b>Yona</b>: Um, why pony glowing?
[doors open]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: It must be a really important one.
<b>Rarity</b>: And terribly far away.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Just getting there will take days!
<b>Applejack</b>: Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
<b>Mane Six except Applejack</b>: [gasp]
[theme song]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Should we send our students home?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!
<b>Rarity</b>: In the middle of my friendship quilting class? I think not! All of those unfinished seams! [faints]
<b>Applejack</b>: Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't worry, everypony. I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You want <i>me</i> to be headmare?!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're the <i>perfect</i> choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Which is why I've prepared everything you need.
[bell ringing]
[door opens]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months...
<b>Spike</b>: Six <i>months</i>?! You're not <i>really</i> gonna be gone <i>that</i> long, are you?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Then why not put <i>him</i> in charge?
<b>Spike</b>: No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I <i>knew</i> I could count on you.
[door closes]
<b>Spike</b>: [yells]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Great. What could possibly go wrong?
[galloping]
<b>Spike</b>: Goodbye, Rarity! A-And everypony!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Come back soon! Please!
<b>Discord</b>: [blows nose]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Huh?
<b>Discord</b>: [through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.
[pop!]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?
<b>Discord 1</b>: Oh, was I not invited to the grand opening?
<b>Discord 2</b>: Friends and Family Day?
<b>Discord 3</b>: Baccalaureate?
<b>All three Discords</b>:  I hadn't noticed.
[flash]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, at least you're here now. Um, why <i>are</i> you here now?
<b>Discord</b>: To fill in for Twilight, of course, as 
head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is
 where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?
<b>Spike</b>: Then you <i>also</i> must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
<b>Discord</b>: Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
[flick]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
<b>Discord</b>: Well, I'm sure that she wouldn't mind a few tiny suggestions. [snaps fingers]
[flash]
<b>Discord</b>: [writing] "Item one – Gravity is optional."
[warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Whoa-oa!
<b>Discord</b>: "Item two – The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."
[marmoset mascot squeaks]
<b>Discord</b>: "Item three—"
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks.
<b>Discord</b>: Reeeeeeally? Well, we'll see if you change your mind. [snaps fingers]
[flash]
[splash]
<b>Spike</b>: Uh-oh. When we play <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i> and he puts that many E's in "really", the things don't usually end well.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old "save Equestria" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?
[door opens]
<b>Spike</b>: Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger 
Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry 
about is teaching class.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we <i>will</i> get through this okay.
[doors open]
[peacocks call]
[Castle Thunder]
[typewriter clicking]
<b>Discord</b>: Come in, come in. You'll let the twittermites out. [munches]
<b>Spike</b>: Twittermites?
[swarming]
<b>Spike</b>: Ow!
[splash]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Discord! What are you doing?!
<b>Spike</b>: [gasps for air]
<b>Discord</b>: Nopony was at your desk. Imagine what Twilight 
would say. [imitating Twilight] Oh, how could you, Starlight?! You've 
broken my trust and failed me completely! [normal voice] Oh, don't 
worry. I'll cover for you. By the way, I hope you like Limburger cheese.
 I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge. [snaps fingers]
[flash]
[crate opening]
<b>Spike</b>: [screams]
[squish!]
<b>Spike</b>: [sniffs, gags]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home.
[door stops]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
[splat]
<b>Spike</b>: Actually, that does sound kinda helpful. And it was next on our to-do list.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Which teachers did you hire?
[stomp]
<b>Iron Will</b>: They call it "making friends", because you have to <i>make</i> creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!
<b>Yona</b>: [clears throat, quietly] Be my friend.
<b>Iron Will</b>: If you're quiet, I don't buy it!
<b>Yona</b>: [louder] Be my friend!
<b>Iron Will</b>: I've heard pudding that's more convincing!
<b>Yona</b>: [huffs, even louder] <i>Be! My! Friend!</i>
[zip!]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.
<b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: Some field trip! Where's my iced tea?! [sips, gulps, spits] This is too cold! [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too hot!
[pours]
<b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too tea-flavored!
[clatter]
<b>Cranky Doodle Donkey</b>: You call yourselves friends?!
<b>Spike</b>: That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
<b>Discord</b>: [sips]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You hired a <i>tree</i> as a teacher?!
<b>Discord</b>: Its schedule was free.
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, guys? That's not just <i>any</i> tree.
<b>Smolder</b>: [sneezes]
<b>Students</b>: [scream]
<b>Spike</b>: [blows nose] It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
<b>Smolder</b>: [sneezes]
<b>Students</b>: [scream]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!
<b>Yona</b>: [yells] <i>BE MY FRIEEEEENNNND!</i>
<b>Discord</b>: Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in 
over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're 
ruining—I mean, <i>running</i> her school?
<b>Students</b>: [screaming]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Discord!
<b>Discord</b>: [munching]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This is all <i>your</i> fault!
<b>Discord</b>: <i>Mine?</i> I thought <i>you</i> were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
[flash]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What I <i>need</i> is for you to leave!
<b>Discord</b>: [snaps fingers]
[flash]
<b>Discord</b>: Happy now?
<b>Spike</b>: Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means.
<b>Discord</b>: Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone.
<b>Spike</b>: I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But why? I thought we were friends.
<b>Spike</b>: Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what.
[nighttime ambience]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Good morning, students! I know there's
 been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their 
trip. But I've brought in <i>new</i> new teachers. And now everything 
should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this 
afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!
<b>Students</b>: [chattering]
[door slams open]
[stock gasp sound]
<b>Discord</b>: [California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!
[flash]
<b>Discord</b>: Is this seat taken?
<b>Ocellus</b>: [laughs nervously]
[poof]
<b>Trixie</b>: Welcome, class! You may call me the Great and Powerful <i>Professor</i> Trrrrrri—
[phone ringing]
<b>Discord</b>: Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!
[phone ringing]
[bananaphone ringing]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, I better take this. Hello?
<b>Voice on bananaphone</b>: [garbled sped-up gibberish]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, he did not! And what did you say?
<b>Voice on bananaphone</b>: [garbled sped-up gibberish]
<b>Discord</b>: [gasps] You did <i>not</i>!
<b>Trixie</b>: Discord! Why are <i>you</i> here?!
<b>Discord</b>: Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.
<b>Trixie</b>: Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!
[banana peels]
<b>Discord</b>: [gulps]
<b>Trixie</b>: Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!
<b>Discord</b>: [snaps fingers]
[Pigasus squeals]
[ursa major roaring]
<b>Students</b>: [scream]
<b>Discord</b>: [chuckles] I'm learning <i>so</i> much. Aren't <i>you</i>?
<b>Trixie</b>: [growls] <i>Discord!</i>
[doors close]
[bananaphone ringing]
[beep]
<b>Trixie</b>: Eh, hello?
<b>Voice on bananaphone</b>: [garbled sped-up gibberish]
<b>Trixie</b>: Um, what exactly <i>is</i> a long-distance plan?
<b>Yona</b>: [pants]
<b>Discord</b>: Take a lap, team!
<b>Sandbar</b>: Uh, actually, we just finished Professor Spitfire's workout.
<b>Discord</b>: Sounds like somepony needs a little motivation. [blows whistle]
[flash]
<b>Students</b>: [gasp, scream]
[bugbear growls]
<b>Silverstream</b>: I've never run so fast in my life! Oh, this is great!
<b>Sandbar</b>: [pants] Hey, coach, we need a break.
<b>Discord</b>: Friendship is about honesty. So believe me when I say... <i>we're not stopping!</i> [blows whistle]
<b>Sandbar</b>: [yelps, pants]
[bugbear growls]
<b>Yona</b>: [panting] Yona... can't run... faster...! [grunts]
[bugbear growls]
[zap!]
[bugbear whimpers]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know <i>why</i> you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!
[flash]
<b>Discord</b>: I wouldn't be so sure.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This is your last warning.
<b>Spike</b>: Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, he's not acting like it!
<b>Spike</b>: [huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?
<b>Discord</b>: <i>My</i> problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school <i>my problem?!</i>
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps, yells]
[zap!]
[crackles]
<b>Students</b>: [shudder]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.
<b>Spike</b>: That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Because he's right about <i>one</i> thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
<b>Spike</b>: No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
[school bell rings]
<b>Spike</b>: We can figure that out <i>after</i> the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!
[doors open]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: For this afternoon's Spell-venger 
Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're 
hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to
 keep track of your score.
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!
[gong strikes]
<b>Students</b>: [chattering]
<b>Spike</b>: C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!
<b>Students</b>: [chatter continues]
<b>Smolder</b>: I hope you know where you're going.
<b>Ocellus</b>: To the Helm of Yksler!
<b>Smolder</b>: Eh, works for me.
<b>Ocellus</b>: In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable 
yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I
 think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor.
<b>Smolder</b>: I'm guessing that one.
[shields flash]
<b>Ocellus</b>: Yes! One down, five to go!
[slaps]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?
<b>Ocellus</b>: Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!
<b>Ocellus</b> and <b>Smolder</b>: [scream]
<b>Ocellus</b>: The school is haunted!
<b>Smolder</b>: And not cool!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasp]
<b>Silverstream</b>: We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!
<b>Gallus</b>: Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday.
[thud]
<b>Gallus</b>: The Crown of Grover! Score!
[shimmer!]
<b>Gallus</b>: They say it's magic <i>and</i> King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?
<b>Silverstream</b>: You paid attention in class!
<b>Gallus</b>: What?! I-If you ever tell an—
[slam!]
<b>Gallus</b>: Whoa!
<b>Silverstream</b>: 3D painting!
<b>King Grover Painting</b>: [screeches]
<b>Gallus</b> and <b>Silverstream</b>: [scream]
<b>Changeling Painting</b>: [hisses]
[students screaming]
<b>Pony Painting</b>: [hisses]
[students screaming]
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: [laughing]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good.
<b>Spike</b>: I thought you banished him from the school.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this.
[lift clanking]
<b>Spike</b>: How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: This time, I'm not using magic.
<b>Yona</b>: Hmm... What Yona look for?
<b>Sandbar</b>: The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a 
seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet 
poem in our book about it. "Climb to the heights with dragon flight." 
[gasps] Like flight of stairs!
<b>Yona</b>: Yona take pony word for it.
[squish]
<b>Yona</b>: Huh?
<b>Sandbar</b>: [grunts] What's happening?!
<b>Yona</b>: Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona <i>do</i> know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: [laughing] Boo! Boo! Boo!
[students screaming]
<b>Ocellus</b>: [yelps] Whoa!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Everycreature, stop!
<b>Silverstream</b>: B-B-B-But the school is haunted!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It's not haunted. It's Discord.
[poof!]
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: Headmare Starlight! Look at me! Look! I won the Spell-venger Hunt! Well done, me! Now what's my prize?
<b>Spike</b>: Detention.
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: Well, that's disappointing.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: On the contrary. I think I rather can. And will.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Then I have just one thing to say to you.
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: Oh, do go on.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm sorry.
<b>Discord's Ghost</b>: What?
[zap!]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.
<b>Discord</b>: Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Nopony ever invited you to the 
school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried 
about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a 
good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of 
vice headmare.
<b>Spike</b>: Huh?
<b>Silverstream</b>: Really?!
<b>Gallus</b>: What?!
<b>Ocellus</b>: Why?!
<b>Yona</b>: No!
<b>Smolder</b>: Him?!
<b>Sandbar</b>: Totally confused.
<b>Discord</b>: I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some
 time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own 
office, expense account, parking space...
<b>Spike</b>: You're new to the world of education, aren't you?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?
<b>Discord</b>: But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
<b>Spike</b>: Hey! Watch the wings!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order.
<b>Discord</b>: [snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
[rattling]
<b>Silverstream</b>: [screams]
<b>Discord</b>: [chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.
[doors open]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Discord!</i> I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, back so soon?
<b>Rarity</b>: A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A fake summons from the map?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us.
<b>Yona</b>: Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.
<b>Spike</b>: [to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!
