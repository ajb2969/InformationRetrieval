[cheerful music] 
<b>Spike</b>: Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean "completely out of view". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming? 
[flame bursts] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason. 
<b>Spike</b>: I have  <i>lots</i> of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [chuckles nervously] 
<b>Spike</b>: Reason number one – I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two – the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three – she's coming here to learn more about friendship. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights. 
<b>Spike</b>: Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants  <i>my</i> advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike! 
<b>Spike</b>: I... I just want things to be perfect. 
[tap, tap] 
<b>Spike</b>: [gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: 
[nervously] Hey! <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: 
[nervously] Hello! <b>Thorax</b>: Oooh! I can't believe you did all this for me! Great banner! Love the stage! What's this flame thingy? Oh, it's pretty! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?! 
<b>Spike</b>: Apparently. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both? 
<b>Spike</b>: I have no idea. [whimpers] <b>Spike</b>: I completely forgot! Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over. I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember! What am I gonna do?! [teeth chattering] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, maybe they'll like each other. 
<b>Spike</b>: Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is... 
<b>Thorax</b>: Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever! Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon? 
[warbles] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other. 
<b>Spike</b>: Or worse – they'll  <i>hate</i> each other! And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight... [gulps] I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin Equestria as we know it! [gasps] [battle music] 
[explosion] <b>Spike</b>: [hyperventilates] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together. 
<b>Spike</b>: So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you? 
<b>Thorax</b>: Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both. 
<b>Spike</b>: No! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh-oh! [whimpers] 
<b>Spike</b>: Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Uh, aren't you coming? 
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh. 
[whip] 
[whoosh] 
[boom] 
[fanfare plays] 
<b>Spike</b>: Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands  <i>and</i> for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech. 
<b>Ember</b>: Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing. 
<b>Spike</b>: [chuckles] 
<b>Ember</b>: This place has a lot of colors. In the Dragon Lands, everything's just rocks or the color of ash. [sneezes] 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Ember</b>: That's probably why. 
[ponies screaming] 
<b>Ember</b>: Hey, Twilight! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, I'm  <i>Star</i>light. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. 
<b>Ember</b>: Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of "-lights" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight? 
<b>Spike</b>: She's in her castle. D'oh! 
<b>Ember</b>: We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying "hi" to your friends, right? 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, well, yeah, but... [nervous stammering] 
<b>Ember</b>: You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache? 
<b>Spike</b>: Dah. I think I feel one coming on. 
<b>Ember</b>: Well, you know what us dragons say. "Push past the pain!" Now, let's go. 
<b>Spike</b>: Or we could stay here. 
<b>Ember</b>: Or I could go without you. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs] Ah, I like her. 
<b>Spike</b>: Ohhh. [door opens] 
<b>Spike</b>: Good. They're not here. 
<b>Ember</b>: What was that? 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, I... I said, "It's all clean in here!" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet. <b>Ember</b>: [crunching loudly] So this is something friends do? I could get used to this. [resumes chomping] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, that's not food. 
<b>Spike</b>: [aside] Dragons love gems! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Fine, but  <i>you're</i> telling Twilight what happened to her wall. 
<b>Ember</b>: [continues chomping] 
<b>Spike</b>: Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things! 
<b>Ember</b>: Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet. 
<b>Spike</b>: Just gotta use the little dragons' room! 
<b>Ember</b>: [chomps] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake. 
[door opens] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly] This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh, what happened to the ice cream? 
<b>Spike</b>: What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Aah! 
[thud] 
<b>Spike</b>: Be right back! 
<b>Thorax</b>: But we didn't get to talk yet! [groans] <b>Spike</b>: Ember's here! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places? 
<b>Spike</b>: I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this. 
[shimmering sounds] 
<b>Spike</b>: Dah! What's happening?! [whimpers] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think it's the map. It's calling...  <i>you</i>. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem! 
[dramatic sting] <b>Spike</b>: The map is calling  <i>me</i>?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out! 
[beat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not a good time? I get it. 
[door opens] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and—oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good. 
<b>Spike</b>: I know! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh. 
<b>Spike</b>: Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean "find the friendship problem". 
<b>Spike</b>: Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure. <b>Spike</b>: Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay. 
<b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: [grunts] Well,  <i>I</i> think vanilla strawberry cream  <i>is</i> overused! 
<b>Sweetie Drops</b>: Hmph. 
<b>Spike</b>: Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem? <b>Ember</b>: Mmm. Mmm. I'm stuffed. [belches] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ember, there you are! 
<b>Ember</b>: Okay, right. More pony hugs. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How's your trip to Ponyville so far? 
<b>Ember</b>: Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [laughs nervously] Oh, my. 
<b>Ember</b>: Where'd Spike and Starlight go? I feel like I'm being avoided. [snorts] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town? 
<b>Ember</b>: Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] <b>Thorax</b>: [grunting, sighs] 
[door closes] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Oh! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do? 
<b>Thorax</b>: But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat? 
<b>Thorax</b>: Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I  <i>am</i> a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle? 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew! <b>Spike</b>: ...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship. 
<b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike! 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, come on! Glow! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 
<b>Spike</b>: Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really,  <i>really</i> great idea. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Well, maybe now we can talk. 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, sssssure. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'll leave you guys to it. 
<b>Thorax</b>: First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice. 
<b>Spike</b>: Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Here's my problem. There's this renegade group of changelings who still feed off of love. Even though I said, "Hey let's not do that anymore," they say, "Hey, this is how we've been doing things for hundreds of years..." [crossfades] ...but it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader and I have to... [fades out] [ponies sounding interested] 
<b>Ember</b>: Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons! [roars] 
[ponies scream] 
<b>Ember</b>: Usually when I do that, the dragons are  <i>eager</i> to meet me. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's not how  <i>ponies</i> make friends. 
<b>Ember</b>: Ah, I get it. 
<b>Derpy</b>: [slurps] 
<b>Ember</b>: This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right? 
[splat] 
[honk!] 
[beat] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, you guys are in town, too? 
<b>Ember</b>: What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No. I'm  <i>Star</i>light. 
[beat] 
<b>Ember</b>: Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and  <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What?! <b>Thorax</b>: ...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one? 
<b>Crusoe Palm</b>: This is  <i>my</i> seat! I saw it first! 
<b>"Rainbow Stars"</b>: Well,  <i>I</i> got here first! 
<b>Spike</b>: Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second. 
<b>Crusoe Palm</b> and  <b>"Rainbow Stars"</b>: [growl] 
<b>Spike</b>: Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I think if you made a little effort, you'd find— Whoa! Okay, that had to have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think  <i>I</i> should do? 
<b>Spike</b>: [gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh,  <i>really</i> come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back. 
<b>Thorax</b>: [sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine. <b>Ember</b>: I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckles] Mine's more of a  <i>glimmer</i>. Heh. 
<b>Ember</b>: How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar. 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else. 
<b>Ember</b>: But I'm  <i>right</i>! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day! 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh, well,  <i>I've</i> seen  <i>you</i>. 
<b>Ember</b>:  <i>Are you calling me a liar?!</i> 
<b>Spike</b>: [chatters] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Hey! No one yells at my friend! 
[transformation noise] 
<b>Thorax</b>: [bear growl] 
<b>Ember</b>: Spike, get away from the bear! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Not anymore! [bear roar] 
<b>Ember</b>: [roars] 
<b>Thorax</b>: [bear growl] 
<b>Spike</b>: [screams] My worst fears are happening! <b>Spike</b>:  <i>Noooo!</i> 
<b>Thorax</b>: [pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back! 
<b>Ember</b>:  <i>You</i> back away! I'm not gonna let  <i>you</i> harm  <i>him</i>! Wait. Did you say you're  <i>not</i> gonna let me harm Spike? 
<b>Thorax</b>: Yeah! 
<b>Ember</b>: But that's what  <i>I'm</i> doing! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Uh, what? 
<b>Ember</b>: Yeah, what? 
<b>Spike</b>: [panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie—! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting? 
<b>Ember</b>: Why would we be fighting? 
<b>Spike</b>: Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day? 
<b>Ember</b> and  <b>Thorax</b>: So what? 
<b>Spike</b>: So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along. 
<b>Ember</b>: Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship? 
<b>Spike</b>: No, no, of course not! But— Wait. Isn't that why you're here? 
<b>Ember</b>:  <i>I</i> can say I'm bad at friendship.  <i>You</i> can't say it about  <i>me</i>! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it. 
<b>Spike</b>: Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry. 
<b>Thorax</b>: No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings! 
<b>Spike</b>: No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done? [splash] 
[kick] 
[splash] 
<b>Ember</b>: Why are  <i>you</i> still here? 
<b>Thorax</b>: [sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home. 
<b>Ember</b>: Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then— 
<b>Ember</b>: Shhh! Stop talking. 
[beat] 
<b>Ember</b>: That's how you do it. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Whoa! That just gave me chills. 
<b>Ember</b>: I know you have it in you. You turned into a  <i>bear</i> to defend Spike. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself. 
<b>Ember</b>: There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Oh, well, that's good advice. 
<b>Ember</b>: I know it is. 
<b>Thorax</b>: So what's  <i>your</i> deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship? 
<b>Ember</b>: I don't want to talk about it. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems? 
<b>Ember</b>: Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course. [grunts, roars] 
[explosion] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Uh, how does that help? 
[crunch] 
<b>Ember</b>: Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel  <i>great</i>. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Right, but, uh, how do you think  <i>they</i> feel? 
<b>Ember</b>: Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy. 
<b>Thorax</b>: That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does. 
<b>Ember</b>: [sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings. 
<b>Thorax</b>: You know you don't have to be sappy... 
<b>Ember</b>: [blows] 
<b>Thorax</b>: ...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel. 
<b>Ember</b>: Uh, I know where we can start. 
[whoosh] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there. <b>Spike</b>: I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again. 
[thuds] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Or they want to see you now. 
<b>Spike</b>: [gulps] 
<b>Ember</b>: Guess what, Spike. 
<b>Spike</b>: I know. I'm so sorry. 
<b>Ember</b>:  <i>Let me talk about this!</i> I... feel... [strains]  <i>mad</i>. [sighs] 
<b>Thorax</b>: Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific? 
<b>Ember</b>: [cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs]  <i>upset!</i> 
<b>Spike</b>: You have every right to be. 
<b>Ember</b>:  <i>I know I do!</i> And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does! 
<b>Thorax</b>: Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive! 
[thud] 
<b>Spike</b>: Whoa. 
<b>Ember</b>: Nice. 
<b>Ember</b> and  <b>Thorax</b>: Ha-ha! 
<b>Spike</b>: You guys  <i>should</i> be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me? 
<b>Ember</b>: I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good. 
<b>Thorax</b>: Hah. Me, too. [pleased sounds] 
<b>Ember</b>: [groans] Again? 
<b>Spike</b>: [laughing] 
[spikes shimmering] 
<b>Spike</b>: No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Actually, you  <i>created</i> the friendship problem by not trusting your friends. 
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good job, Spike. 
<b>Ember</b>: Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>,  <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>, and  <b>Spike</b>: [giggling] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah, pretty much. 
<b>Spike</b>: Yup. [ponies chattering] 
<b>Spike</b>: [through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity. 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Ember</b>: [sneezes] 
[whoosh] 
[crowd gasps] 
[beat] 
<b>Ember</b>: You should have more things made of rocks. 
[beat] 
<b>Spike</b>,  <b>Ember</b>, and  <b>Thorax</b>: [laughing] [credits]
