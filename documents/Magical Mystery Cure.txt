This is very, very bad. 
<b>Spike</b>: What's going on? Why is this happening?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Dear Twilight Sparkle,</i> 
<i>The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece.</i> [gasps] Ooh!  <i>He was never able to get it right, and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia</i> 
<i>From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled.</i> That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something  <i>did</i> happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong! 
<b>Spike</b>: So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. There  <i>is</i> no counter-spell! 
<b>Spike</b>: Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered! 
<b>Spike</b>: Zecora's cure for the cutie pox? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That won't work either... 
<b>Spike</b>: Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault. 
<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   I have to find a way   </dd>  <dd>   To make this all okay   </dd>  <dd>   I can't believe this small mistake   </dd>  <dd>   Could've caused so much heartache   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   Oh why, oh why?   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   Losing promise   </dd>  <dd>   I don't know what to do   </dd>  <dd>   Seeking answers   </dd>  <dd>   I fear I won't get through to you   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   Oh why, oh why?   </dd> </dl> <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, Spike, what have I done? <b>Spike</b>: Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this.

<b>Spike</b>: Twilight? Are you alright? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got it! I know what to do! 
<b>Spike</b>: You do? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike! [bits clinking] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy, wait! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh... Hey, Twilight...

<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh. 
[whoopee cushion deflating] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: But... I don't really know anything about animals... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But you  <i>do</i> know something about Rainbow Dash. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her. [thunk] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [muffled] Whoa! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs  <i>you</i>! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look!

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all  <i>your</i> students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: [giggles] There will be time for all of that later. <b>Princess Celestia</b>: We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say  <i>I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful.</i> Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!
