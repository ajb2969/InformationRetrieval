<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Animal shows, carnival rides... 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And all kinds of food on a stick! [slurps] 
[thud] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: For there and back. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And our train tickets are all set. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I've got our whole itinerary planned! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and 
 <b>Scootaloo</b>: [laugh] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and 
 <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Mm-hmm! 
[pause] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: So when's Rainbow Dash comin'? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I thought you were gonna ask Applejack. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [to Sweetie Belle] I don't suppose you asked Rarity? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well. 
[clatter] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We really did think of everything except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today! 
<b>Rarity</b>: I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Can't you finish it tomorrow? 
[smack!] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe we should just go by ourselves? 
<b>Rarity</b>: What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too young to go alone. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility. You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could end up in hot water or worse. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We know. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I guess that means Twilight's busy, too? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its magical properties, maybe we can save it. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So that's a "no" on going with us to the fair? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and none of them can come. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop... 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We know! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I'm pretty sure if 
 <i>you</i> wanted to go to the fair, you could. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's 
 <i>Tome of Flora and Fauna</i>? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think there's a copy in the library filed under "Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts". Unless I put it under "Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications". 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Every pony but us. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up. 
[magic sounds] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem. 
[louder magic sounds] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I just wish we were as old as our sisters. Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves. 
[even louder magic sounds] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, Sweetie Belle, why's your face all lit up? 
[high-pitched humming] 
[zap!] 
[whooshing] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [whimpering] 
[whooshing stops] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [groan] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] 
[shatter!] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [gasp] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Do you know what this means? 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We can go to the fair! [laugh] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I hope you brought the tickets. We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I think we'll be fine. Check out how fast we're going! Grown-up legs are strong! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You're not kidding! 
[rattling] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't know how much of this my scooter can take! 
[ponies gasp] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And nopony yelled at us to slow down even once! Being a grown-up is great! 
[pocketwatch ticking] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [panting] 
[train whistle blows] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [sigh] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We made it! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Of course we did! We're grown-up ponies now! We can do anything! And all those worries Twilight and the others had don't apply anymore. Because we're big! And bein' big is all it takes!

[train chugging] 
[brakes hiss] 
[train chugging] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I think I ate too many snacks. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, this doesn't look like Appleloosa. 
<b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: That's because it isn't... 
[creaking] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: You all heard that, right? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, hello? [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] Do you think we got on the wrong train? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go. 
<b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [scream] 
<b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Maybe we should wait for the train. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And miss the fair?! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow the directions? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Come on. We didn't come all this way for nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a grown-up, it'll be a snap. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Grown-ups always know the way! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Because being big is all it takes! 
<b>"Loose Tracks"</b>: [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry. I've got kind of a throat thing. 
[montage music]

<b>Scootaloo</b>: Aah!

[vines stretch, recoil] 
[bubbling]

<b>Scootaloo</b>: Sweetie Belle, are you sure this is the right way?

[bushes rustle] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Scootaloo? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Aah! 
[thud] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Don't do that! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Girls? 
[snap!] 
[thud] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Maybe we should head back to the station. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I'm not sure we can. I think we're lost. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Just like Twilight and the others said! 
<b>Spur</b>: Well, where were you when I was feeding and caring for him?! 
[bushes rustle] 
<b>Biscuit</b>: [screams] Wild swamp ponies! 
<b>"Spring Green"</b> and 
 <b>"Savage Honeydew"</b>: Hmph! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We're not wild swamp ponies. We're just grown-ups. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And we are definitely not lost. 
<b>Spur</b>: Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit. 
[rattling] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Hey, that's where we're going! 
<b>Spur</b>: No, it isn't! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, which is it? 
<b>Spur</b>: Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's 
 <i>my</i> pet, too. 
<b>Spur</b>: Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him! 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him? 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [chittering] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: He seems okay meetin' us. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right? 
<b>Spur</b>: Y'all don't really think that, do ya? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: If they go to the fair, we can tag along! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: That is some quality grown-up advice! 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [chittering] 
<b>Spur</b>: But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more. 
[ponies chattering] 
[horseshoe clangs] 
[splash!] 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [laughs] It's everything I thought it'd be! 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [squealing] 
<b>Passerby Pony</b>: Well, my goodness, what an interesting critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to win "Most Interesting Creature"! 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Animals showcase? That's exactly what we should do! 
<b>Spur</b>: That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown-ups think? 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [laugh] 
[thunk!] 
[bell rings] 
[ponies cheer] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [laugh] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo! 
[splat] 
<b>Spur</b>: What happened to being able to ask your advice?! You ran off the second we got here! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Where's Biscuit and Bloofy? 
<b>Spur</b>: That's why I came to find you. 
[fanfare] 
[ponies chattering] 
<b>Spur</b>: It's one thing to bring Bloofy to the fair, but it's another to stick him in a showcase! 
<b>Biscuit</b>: What's the big deal? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You are supposed to be sharing him. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, I'm with Biscuit. The showcase looks like fun. 
<b>Spur</b>: Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun! 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [shrieking] 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out. 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [chitters, sniffs] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break? 
<b>Spur</b>: You mean, like, leave? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah. What could go wrong? 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [chittering] 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [squealing] 
[whooshing] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Me and my big grown-up mouth. 
[ponies screaming] 
[whooshing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Do you think this qualifies as gettin' into a dangerous situation with no grown pony to help us? 
[cow moos] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I think 
 <i>we're</i> the grown ponies that need to be helping today! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Bloofy! Treats, treats, treats! Who wants a treat? 
[whooshing continues] 
[teleportation zap] 
<b>Biscuit</b>: What do we do now?! 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: 
 <i>Run!</i> 
[train whistle blows] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope you're right about the girls coming here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic! 
[distant screaming] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. Or that. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And we thought we could take the train here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just like you said we would! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And got lost! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Just like you said we would! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Then we met these foals who led us to the fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town! 
[whooshing] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth! They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited. 
[crash!] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: This one's excited. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: How do we calm him down? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe. 
[teleportation zap] 
[ewe bleats] 
<b>Spur</b>: 
 <i>That's</i> Bloofy?! 
[teleportation zap] 
<b>Biscuit</b>: I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us. 
<b>Spur</b>: What do you mean, "seem" like grown-ups? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it. 
<b>Spur</b>: How? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you. 
<b>Spur</b>: Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay. 
[whooshing stops] 
<b>Bloofy</b>: [squeals, chitters] 
<b>Spur</b>: How did you know what to do? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things. 
<b>Spur</b>: Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the "Most Interesting Creature" prize. 
<b>Biscuit</b>: I'm sorry I didn't listen to you. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We all are. 
<b>Spur</b>: I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so. 
<b>Spur</b>: What do you mean? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We wish we were foals again. 
[magic sounds] 
<b>Biscuit</b>: Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day. 
<b>Spur</b>: I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Deal! 
<b>All</b>: [laughing]
