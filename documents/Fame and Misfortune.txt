[splat] 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: Oops! Sorry, Princess Twilight. That was meant for  <i>her</i>. Incoming! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Whoa! 
[clink] 
[splat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Toola Roola, Coconut Cream, what are you doing?! 
<b>Coconut Cream</b>: That was meant for my  <i>ex</i>-friend. 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: I'm not  <i>your</i> ex-friend – you're  <i>my</i> ex-friend! 
[multiple splats] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Both of you, stop! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...So you see, friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for. 
<b>Coconut Cream</b> and  <b>Toola Roola</b>: Awww! [laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm. That sounds familiar. [gasps] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What is  <i>that</i>? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like: "Friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for." 
[paper rustling] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'll judge a book by its cover just this once. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grumbles] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks for coming, everypony. I've got a surprise for you. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: What is it, Twilight? Do I need to prepare myself? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's this! 
[magic zap] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, what is that thing? Why is it so smelly? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'll say! 
[pages turning] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons. 
[page turns] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you. 
[pages turning] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I-I don't even know what  <i>this</i> is. 
<b>Rarity</b>: It is called  <i>calligraphy</i>, darling. If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous. 
[page unfolding] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard. 
[confetti explodes] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] Well, I  <i>am</i> surprised! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That wasn't the only surprise. 
[magic zap] 
[pages rustling] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you! 
<b>Applejack</b>: That's amazin'! A perfect copy! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain— [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto. 
<b>Rarity</b>: [sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do? "Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back." 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah!  <i>Birth-iversary!</i> 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: After Twilight remembered the journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I just had to have my own copy. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And that brings me to the second part of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I think that's a great idea. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm in! Yay! 
<b>Applejack</b>: W-We always said we wanted to. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Sounds fabulous. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] I'm awesome. 
[pause] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, yeah. Uh, good idea. [montage music] [foals chattering] 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: No! I don't wanna play with you anymore! 
<b>Coconut Cream</b>: Why not?! You love playing hopskotch! 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: No,  <i>you</i> do because you always win! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, girls. Couldn't help but overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help. 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: Sure, Princess. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We were thinkin' of puttin' together a cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: A cutie mark camp  <i>is</i> a great idea. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be  <i>marketing</i>. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will— Whoa! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Uh, hello! Can I... help you? 
<b>Out of Town Pony</b>: We're here all the way from Fillydelphia because we got copies of your friendship journal! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship— 
<b>Out of Town Pony</b>: Will you sign them?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons? 
<b>Out of Town Pony</b>: Oh, we haven't read them. These are keepsakes. We gotta keep them in mint condition. Ha-ha. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. 
<b>Out of Town Pony 2</b>: Wow, that was worth the trip! 
[visiting ponies chattering excitedly] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure lots of other ponies are being inspired to be better friends. 
<b>Diamond Cutter</b>: Well, I for one found the journal  <i>terribly</i> illuminating. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Daisy</b>: I agree. I'm seeing sides of these ponies I didn't know were there. I only wish they'd left Rarity out.  <i>She</i> clearly doesn't belong in that book with the rest of them. 
<b>Diamond Cutter</b>: Oh, I know! Who does she think she is? Certainly she did a fine job setting up the Ponyville Days celebration, but does she really believe it was a success just because of her? [inconsiderate laughter] The nerve! 
[paper rustling] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [bawling] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But that's not what she was saying! Rarity! <b>Rarity</b>: [crying] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, poor Rarity. She overheard all the mean things those ponies were saying. She must be devastated. I'm going after her. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Go ahead. I'm gonna have a  <i>chat</i> with these two. <b>Rarity</b>: [crying] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, wait! 
[smack] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight! Isn't it amazing? Our journals are everywhere! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie, I've got to— 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are  <i>hilarious</i>! 
[scribbling] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am so glad to hear  <i>some</i> ponies are being inspired by the journal. 
<b>Cherry Berry</b>: Hey, look! There's Pinkie Pie! The funny one! 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Giggly feedback is the best kind! 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, at least you're getting a positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal thing really upset her. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, that's too bad. 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait. That wasn't even funny. 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: O-kay. Well, I guess I'll catch you later. 
[beat] 
<b>Cherry Berry</b>: [coughs] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yup. Bye, Twilight! 
[ponies laughing] 
<b>Sassaflash</b>: Hah! Classic Pinkie! Oh, she's even funnier in real life! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>You've known me for years!</i> 
[ponies laughing] [pages rustling] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe it's time to call it a day. 
<b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: I wipped out all the Twilight Spawkle lessons 'cause they were getting in the way of the good ones. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What do you mean you skipped the lessons? We've  <i>all</i> had valuable experiences. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey,  <i>here's</i> a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to  <i>Twilight</i> for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else. 
<b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: Aw, we don't wanna hear her bowing lessons! Come on! Tell us again about when you met Dawing Do! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times? 
<b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: We can't get enough of it! Come on, you don't want to disappoint your fans! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh... It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their... pens. 
<b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: Oh, cool! We'll come along. You can tell us the stowy there. 
<b>Pegasus Fillies</b>: Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! [ponies chattering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, what's going on now? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Please, just leave me alone! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy, what's wrong? 
<b>Glasses Stallion</b>: We want answers! 
<b>"Lemon Chiffon"</b>: Yeah! We're entitled to know! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What is it, everypony? 
<b>"Lemon Chiffon"</b>: We wanna know why Fluttershy keeps learning the same thing over and over again! Be assertive already! 
<b>"Wisp"</b>: Even  <i>I've</i> learned more than she has! Why can't  <i>I</i> be in the book?! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I  <i>am</i> more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that  <i>you</i> could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so. 
<b>Glasses Stallion</b>: Wow. You're way different from the Fluttershy in the book. I don't know how I feel about that. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [sighs] 
[ponies chattering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It feels like everypony in Equestria is missing the "friendship" part of the friendship journals. [door opens] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, are you alright? [yelps] 
[smash] 
[sewing machine whirr] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What are you doing? 
<b>Rarity</b>: Why, I'm creating a gown, darling! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: For what? 
<b>Rarity</b>: I don't know! I'm stress-sewing! [frustrated noises] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stress-sewing? 
<b>Rarity</b>: When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What? Why are ponies cancelling their orders? 
[squeak] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Because nopony likes me any more! They're boycotting me! [grunts] 
[ponies chattering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sure if I go out there and talk to those ponies, they'll see that they're being unreasonable. 
[door opens] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [panting] I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now! Sorry, Twilight. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me! 
<b>Applejack</b>: I don't need nothin' fancy. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's the matter, Applejack? 
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm popular, Twilight! I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You go ahead. I'll stay here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales and exhales] 
[sewing machine whirr] [loud pony chattering] 
[squeaking] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [frustrated groan] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack, who  <i>are</i> all these ponies? 
<b>Applejack</b>: They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers. They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family. And now they actually wanna  <i>become</i> part of the family! 
[camera flashes] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Your journal entries? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Can't you get rid of them? 
<b>Applejack</b>: And kick out my own family?! Granny Smith, hang on! Let me help! 
<b>Sweet Apple Admirer</b>: There she is! 
<b>Ponies</b>: Yee-haw! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] I wish we'd never released that journal. <b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: There you are! Okay, I just left Rarity. I think she's doing better, and— Oh, boy. Window-staring, huh? Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's bad everywhere. I thought I was doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the  <i>big idea</i> to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I really think you're being too hard on yourself. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Am I?! 
[knocking] 
[door opens] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps] 
[loud chattering] 
[doors slam] 
[crunch] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] 
<b>Applejack</b>: I didn't know where else to go! I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk! Not even  <i>I</i> want to be funny  <i>all</i> the time! I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are  <i>over</i>! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You think  <i>you've</i> got problems? I  <i>know</i> I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am! [beat] Uh, Rarity? What are you wearing? 
<b>Rarity</b>: My emotions, darling! Stress couture! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself  <i>one more time!</i> 
<b>Rarity</b>: Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry, darling. Force of habit. 
[curtain drawing] 
[loud muffled chatter] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [snoring] 
[pop] 
[crunch] 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay, so maybe they are having a hard time with it. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, I did! Releasing the journal was  <i>my</i> idea, and it backfired in ways I could never have imagined! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It's not your fault. It's everypony else's! They're just focusing on the wrong things, and— [gasps] Wait here! I've got an idea! 
[magic zap] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't wait any longer. I've got to fix this. 
[ponies arguing loudly] 
[doors open] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everypony, please stop! 
[ponies arguing loudly] 
<b>Reporter Pony</b>: Princess Twilight, I'm with the  <i>Canterlot Chronicle</i>. Quick question — what would you say to ponies who wonder why you moved to Ponyville in the first place? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I moved here to learn about friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've learned so much from— 
<b>Reporter Pony</b>: What I mean is, some ponies would argue that it doesn't seem believable that the six of you would be friends. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "Believable"? 
<b>Reporter Pony</b>: Well, sure. I read this journal cover to cover, and I have to say your character would have been much more interesting if she'd stayed in Canterlot. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My  <i>character</i>?! We are  <i>real</i> ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them! 
<b>Diamond Cutter</b>: What about Rarity? Are we really supposed to believe everything she wrote in there? 
<b>"Princess Erroria"</b>: That's why you wanna be Team Dash! She's the only one that didn't weally need to learn anything, because she was alweady so cool. 
<b>Pearly Stitch</b>: Twilight was better before she got wings! 
<b>"Lemon Chiffon"</b>: Fluttershy is just so painfully shy, it's hard to relate! I mean, come on! 
[angry chattering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait a minute, everypony! 
<b>Caramel</b>: Are Pinkie Pie and Applejack related or what?! 
[more angry chattering]

<b>Toola Roola</b>: Um, we just wanted to say thank you. To all of you. 
<b>Coconut Cream</b>: Yeah, our friendship? Well, we were having trouble until we read your journal. It showed us that friends can go through all sorts of tough times and come through stronger than before. 
<b>Toola Roola</b>: It's made us better friends than we've ever been! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Really? 
<b>Coconut Cream</b> and  <b>Toola Roola</b>: Mm-hmm.
