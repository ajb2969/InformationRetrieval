[splashing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Just one more time? Please? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Alright, but this is the last one. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo! 
[splash] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [spluttering] Who done that?! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: How come? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I wasn't always this way... 
[telecine beeping] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could even  <i>look</i> at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough to stay afloat. 
[splash] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [panicked noises] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water? 
[Jaws-theme BGM] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Aah! 
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nope. 
<b>Applejack</b> and  <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing] <b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wow, Granny. I can't believe you were a high diver! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: The best one in Ponyville! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Do you think I could be a high diver? 
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nope. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Absolutely not. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But– 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I know, but– 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest, darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through the air to the Pegasi. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun. 
[ponies talking] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Wow. I wonder where everypony's headed. 
[distant fairground music] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Aw, quit bein' such a worry-worm and follow your ears! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Come on, Applejack, aren't you curious? 
[fairground music gets closer] [ponies chattering] 
[crank turning] 
[steam puffing] <b>Flim</b>: Thank you, one and all, for your attendance, and we guarantee that your time here will not be spent in vain! 
<b>Flam</b>: In fact, we think it will prove to be the most valuable time you've ever spent! 
<b>Applejack</b>: The Flim Flam Brothers! This should be interestin'. 
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.

<b>Flam</b>: A phenomenon? What's that? 
<b>Flim</b>: It's a circumstance perceptible by the senses, but in this case, it's the simple fact that: <dl>  <dd>   There's ailments all around us in everything we touch and see   </dd> </dl> <b>[Flam]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   A sickness that lies waiting there in every breath you breathe   </dd> </dl> <b>[Flim]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   Disease will up and grab you as it crawls from land and sea   </dd> </dl> <b>[Flam]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   It's amazing how infected that the natural world and all its things can be   </dd> </dl> <b>Flim</b>: Now I understand that some of you don't think you're sick.

<b>Applejack</b>: Are you as worried as I am? 
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup. [splash] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do! 
<b>Applejack</b>: When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: You mean Granny wasted her money? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I don't know about  <i>that</i>, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Howdy! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny?! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hang on now! We'll get ya! 
[splash] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [grunts] 
[splash] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic! 
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm not so sure that tonic really  <i>does</i> anythin'. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Doesn't do anythin'?! What d'you call this? [hums a tune] 
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'? 
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Uh, no. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, quit your bellyachin'! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I think maybe it's time we found out. [Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic in background] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works? 
<b>Applejack</b>: I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe. <b>[Silver Shill]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   –out the door!   </dd> </dl> <b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wait a second! That's that same pony from before! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hey! 
[thudding] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Now hold it right there, Mister...? 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now  <i>you</i> can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all... 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: [gulps] 
<b>Applejack</b>: ...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya? 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: I, uh... 
[whistles blowing] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hey! Huh? 
<b>Flim</b>: Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple! 
<b>Flam</b>: What brings you back to our humble abode? 
<b>Applejack</b>: You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again. 
<b>Flim</b>: What's so bad about that? 
<b>Applejack</b>: If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can  <i>pretend</i> to be cured! 
<b>Flam</b>: Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation. 
<b>Flim</b>: But let's say that it's true... 
<b>Flam</b>: Hypothetically... 
<b>Flim</b>: Theoretically... 
<b>Flam</b>: As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony. 
<b>Flim</b>: The star of the show, once upon a time. 
<b>Flam</b>: But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Until today, that's right. 
<b>Flim</b>: Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves... 
<b>Flam</b>: Hypothetically... 
<b>Flim</b>: Theoretically... 
<b>Flam</b>: The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I guess... 
<b>Flim</b>: So, the question is... 
<b>Flam</b>: Do you  <i>really</i> want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away? 
<b>Applejack</b>: I... 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis. 
<b>Flim</b>: That's the spirit! 
<b>Flam</b>: Come back anytime! [splashing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Granny, wait! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and  <b>Granny Smith</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Uh, what were you sayin', dear? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to! 
[splash] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh. Okay. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic! [ponies chattering] 
<b>Flam</b>: Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes! 
<b>Flim</b>: But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush? 
<b>Flam</b>: Right this way, good sir! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: We'll take the whole case! 
[bits clinking] 
<b>"Jinx"</b>: Are you saying this stuff actually works? 
<b>Applejack</b>: It seems to work for Granny. 
<b>Flim</b>: You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved! 
<b>"Jinx"</b>: If Applejack says it works, that's good enough for me! 
[ponies chattering excitedly] 
[bits clinking] [splash] 
[ponies clapping and cheering] 
[splashing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and  <b>Granny Smith</b>: Hoo-ha, hee-hee, ha-hoo-ha! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right? 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh... good luck, then! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side! 
<b>Flam</b>: Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic! 
<b>Flim</b>: Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it – why shouldn't you? 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Right. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do! 
[splashing] 
[ponies cheering] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I'll be... 
[cameras clicking] 
<b>Snappy Scoop</b>: That was some of the most amazing aquabatics I've ever seen! How in Equestria did you do it? Hard work? Lots of practice? [clicks camera] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic! 
<b>Flim</b>: That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise. 
<b>Flam</b>: Buy it now while supplies last. 
[ponies chattering] 
<b>Applejack</b>: What are  <i>you</i> doin' here? 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Oh, things are going so well, Flim and Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more costumes for this pony. [beat] This is more of a uniform. 
<b>Applejack</b>: If you say so. 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty  <i>isn't</i> the best policy. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Thanks to... me? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack! 
[cameras clicking] 
<b>Applejack</b>: No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen? 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Maybe something like that? 
<b>Applejack</b>: [gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Land sakes! [catching breath] [gasps] 
[whip cracking noises] 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?! 
<b>Applejack</b>: That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high! 
<b>Flim</b>: Twenty times, by my count. 
<b>Flam</b>: Thirty, with a favorable breeze. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake! 
[crowd gasps] 
<b>"Jinx"</b>: But you gave it your stamp of approval! 
<b>Rainbowshine</b>: Are you saying you lied? 
<b>Applejack</b>: ...I am. 
[crowd gasps] 
<b>Applejack</b>: I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did? 
<b>Applejack</b>: I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong! 
<b>Flim</b>: But you just said it boosts confidence! 
<b>Flam</b>: And that's not all it does, folks– 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies believe in a thing that just wasn't so! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble. 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Thank you, Applejack. I got this through dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the truth. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I don't know... 
<b>Silver Shill</b>: Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest. 
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'. 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go? <b>Applejack</b>:  <i>Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that – but I sure ain't one of them.</i> Now you take it easy there, Granny! 
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee!
