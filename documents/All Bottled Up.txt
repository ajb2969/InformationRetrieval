All Bottled Up
Season 7
<b>Trixie</b>: Come on, come on! Turn into a teacup!
[magic zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: No! Teacup!
[magic zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: No! <i>Teacup!</i>
[magic zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: [screeching] <i>No</i>! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It could be because you're just yelling "teacup!" and not picturing it in your mind.
<b>Trixie</b>: Oh. Yeah, that could be it.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
<b>Trixie</b>: [inhales]
[magic zaps]
<b>Trixie</b>: Whoo! Starlight, I did it!
[splurt]
<b>Trixie</b>: Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hey!
<b>Trixie</b>: Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!
[splat]
[teacup poodle yapping]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
<b>Trixie</b>: Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
<b>Trixie</b>: I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! <i>Real</i> magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] "Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was 
baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship 
retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.
<b>Trixie</b>: Oh! You need some snacks to give to Twilight? I've got you covered. [humming to herself]
[splat]
<b>Trixie</b>: Problem solved.
[magic rumbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] Not exactly.
[theme song]
[train whistle blows]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am so excited for this friendship 
retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without 
having to save Equestria.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, we <i>are</i> awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.
<b>Trixie</b>: [groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [nervous laughter]
<b>Trixie</b>: Kidding.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
<b>Trixie</b>: Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria <i>is</i> a friendship retreat, anyway?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.
<b>Trixie</b>: [giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [giggles] Shhh!
<b>Trixie</b>: Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You, too!
[door shuts]
[train rattling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so 
that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. 
Maybe we should start with something smaller.
<b>Trixie</b>: No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, I've always found magic is tied
 to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the 
stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.
<b>Trixie</b>: Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie 
marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an 
entire village.
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
<b>Trixie</b>: See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell—
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Teleportation spell.
<b>Trixie</b>: Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.
<b>Trixie</b>: Spike! How about it?
<b>Spike</b>: [nervous laugh]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?
<b>Trixie</b>: I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
<b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] Welcome to Manehattan Escapes.
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and—
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, it's not <i>that</i> kind of retreat.
<b>Rarity</b>: Isn't it called "Manehattan Escapes" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
<b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Team-building!
<b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Rarity</b>: [sighs]
<b>Applejack</b>: Come on, girls. This could be fun.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm just happy to be with all of you.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, 
but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, 
us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!
<b>Rarity</b>: Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?
<b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hah! Griffons barely like each other! 
We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your 
quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!
<b>Trixie</b>: Challenge accepted!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here.
<b>Trixie</b>: Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No, Trix, wait, not just—
[magic zap]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
[thud]
<b>Trixie</b>: [weakly] Ta-da.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
<b>Trixie</b>: [clears throat] Teleport.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Really?!
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to 
happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole 
table go poof! That was pretty impressive!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie, we <i>have</i> to get that map back.
<b>Trixie</b>: We'll find it. No big deal.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
<b>Trixie</b>: Teleport, like you told me to.
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!
<b>Trixie</b>: [scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.
[dishes clattering]
[door opens]
[crockery shattering]
<b>Spike</b>: Hey, are you okay?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
<b>Spike</b>: Wait, what?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go <i>somewhere</i>, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...
<b>Spike</b>: Hah. I remember that.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: The point is, I don't know what my 
magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do 
who-knows-what to Trixie.
<b>Spike</b>: Are you sure that's a good idea?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: What choice do I have? I've got to 
get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was
 thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.
<b>Spike</b>: Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Trixie!
<b>Trixie</b>: Oh, <i>there</i> you are! For a minute, I didn't
 think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for 
some weird reason. But then I remembered – you never get mad at me.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] 
Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were 
thinking of. Where was that?
<b>Trixie</b>: Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
<b>Trixie</b>: Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Did you remember?
<b>Trixie</b>: Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Cinnamon... nuts?
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's a good idea!
<b>Trixie</b>: Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [exhales] You got this, Starlight...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!
[click, rattling]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woo-hoo!
<b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
<b>Applejack</b>: Don't both those fruits mean purple?
<b>Rarity</b>: Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
[clunking]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!
<b>Trixie</b>: [chewing]
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Ah, hello, fillies. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are those cinnamon nuts?
<b>Trixie</b>: Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: [stuttering] A big ta— Uh, no! Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha.
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that 
transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have 
been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?
<b>Trixie</b>: Sure!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Nope, I ain't seen it.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because <i>somepony</i>...
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: ...was craving apples.
<b>Trixie</b>: I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Granny Smith, <i>please</i>. The table?
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't 
what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done 
appeared out of thin air.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs]
[teapot poodle yapping]
<b>Trixie</b>: Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream 
parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice 
cream, and— Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause 
Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on 
my mind.
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.
<b>Trixie</b>: Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... "lch-bh-ba".
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [groans]
[magic warbling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [tired] Nope. I am great.
<b>Trixie</b>: Did your saddlebag just glow?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] No.
<b>Trixie</b>: Gimme!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] No!
<b>Trixie</b>: Give it here!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] Don't!
<b>Trixie</b>: What's in this?
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Cinnamon nuts!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Uh, me, too! Ever since that Trixie came by with 'em.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Trixie</b>: [straining]
[thud]
[slow motion noise]
[shattering]
[dizzy stars]
<b>Trixie</b>: Um, why are they looking at me like that...?
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: [growling]
<b>Trixie</b>: Whoa!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: You ruined my teacakes!
<b>Trixie</b>: What?! [anxious noises]
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: You just had to give Twilight those smelly pretzels!
<b>Trixie</b>: Were they <i>your</i> pretzels? I don't understand.
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
<b>Trixie</b>: Starlight, can you help me, please?!
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?
[bricks moving]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I've seen those symbols! Over here!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You can do it!
[clanking]
<b>Rarity</b>: Almost there.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I've got the key!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is it! I'm so impressed.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm not. I knew we were the best!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: You're the worst!
<b>Trixie</b>: That seems harsh.
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Hiyaaa!
<b>Trixie</b>: Whoa! <i>Starlight!</i> [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!
[magic fizzling]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I wish that Starlight was here to see 
how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work 
together! You've all taught me so much.
<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>
Friendship used to make me so queasy, queasy
But you made it all so easy, easy
Now I don't have to say what I'm thinking
You already know without even blinking

<b>[Applejack]</b>
You girls are the apple of my eye

<b>[Rainbow Dash]</b>
The race that doesn't end in a tie

<b>[Pinkie Pie]</b>
You are the funnel cake at my fair

<b>[Fluttershy]</b>
The warm hug of a fuzzy bear

<b>[Mane Six]</b>
Best friends until the end of time
We'll have each other's backs
And let our true selves shine
And that's because everything we need is all right here
When we're with our team

<b>Trixie</b>: Starlight! A spark of magic could be very helpful right about now!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [grunting] I can't...!
<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>
I simply can't imagine there'd be a day
Where I wouldn't want to be walking your way
Whatever new problems there may be, may be
Our friendship is always the door with the key

<b>[Rarity]</b>
You are the jewels in my friendship crown

<b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>
The sparks that make my world go 'round

<b>[Mane Six]</b>
We bring the best out, that's our goal
There's no telling how far we'll go

Best friends until the end of time
We'll have each other's backs
And let our true selves shine
And that's because everything we need is all right here
When we're with our team!

<b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: That was lovely. But, um, you know the game isn't over until you turn that key?
[ding]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Gah!
[thud]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [panting] Did we do it?
[buzz]
<b>"Ginger Locks"</b>: So close. You missed the griffon record by two seconds. Probably shouldn't have sung that song.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aw, nuts!
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: [screaming]
<b>Trixie</b>: <i>Nuts!</i>
[crash]
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: <i>You just do whatever you want to do!</i>
<b>Trixie</b>: Starlight!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: And you don't always... [pants] ...have to bring up my dark past!
<b>Trixie</b>: I didn't know you had one, Granny Smith!
<b>Granny Smith</b>: [grunts]
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Oh! I just can't believe you sometimes! You make me so mad!
<b>Trixie</b>: I barely even know you! I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [weakly] They're not. I am.
[magic warbling and rumbling]
<b>Trixie</b>: You are?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You
 lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's 
like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we 
can't find that table, Twilight's <i>never</i> going to trust me again, and the worst part is <i>you didn't even say you were sorry!</i>
<b>Trixie</b>: I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I
 don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my 
anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really 
sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that 
would backfire.
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Aw, that's all right. It was a slow day.
<b>Granny Smith</b>: Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up.
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!
[magic humming]
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: Yay! My nut cart!
<b>"Clarity Cut"</b>: Uh, hang on. Don't you work at the spa?
<b>Bulk Biceps</b>: [gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
[cart squeaking]
<b>Trixie</b>: Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random 
ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed 
to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
<b>Trixie</b>: Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And a magical temper tantrum?
<b>Trixie</b>: Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you 
were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and 
yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the 
fact that you forgive me every time.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
<b>Trixie</b>: Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!
[bell rings]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You're kidding me.
<b>Trixie</b>: There's more to it than that. I was thinking 
about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting –
 here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
[thud]
<b>Spike</b>: A little to the left. Oh, now rotate it just a hair...
[door opens]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, girls! How'd it go?
[loud thud]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Trixie</b>: [simultaneously] Nothing!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...What?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud...
<b>Fluttershy</b>: We learned about team building and problem solving...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And when not to sing songs!
<b>Rarity</b>: We certainly had a good time, but I <i>really</i> was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sounds good to me!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [simultaneously] I have a coupon!
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [simultaneous agreement]
<b>Trixie</b>: We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do 
you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table
 was there?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
<b>Trixie</b>: No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b> and <b>Trixie</b>: [giggling]
