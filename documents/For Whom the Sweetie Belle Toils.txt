<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet?
<b>Rarity</b>: Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>. Perhaps it needs... appliqués.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Appliqués?
<b>Rarity</b>: Or sequins.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Sequins!
[crash]
<b>Rarity</b>: Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Guess I got a little carried away. It's 
just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in 
time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers.
<b>Rarity</b>: This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is <i>the</i>
 pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next 
week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at 
the latest!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But is there time?
<b>Rarity</b>: Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the 
stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple 
Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think
 I need your expertise.
<b>Rarity</b>: My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!
<b>Rarity</b>: But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I understand.
<b>Rarity</b>: I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh, thank you thank you thank you thank you! You're the best sister ever! The dresses are right over there! [giggles]
[theme song]
<b>Cheerilee</b>: My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: She's been <i>very</i> busy lately!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she <i>has</i> known about this for weeks, right?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, 
but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three 
of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that 
this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I
 really wanted to keep it that way!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight!
<b>Cheerilee</b>: Places!
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I'm here, I'm here!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] You made it!
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, 
but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a 
terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you 
ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so.
<b>Cheerilee</b>: Places! Hello?
[fanfare playing]
[applause, oohs and ahhs]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.
[cheers]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Wow! A standin' ovation!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I still have goosebumps!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [deep breath] Let's not get carried away.
 We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with 
adoration and praise. Try to be gracious.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Modest.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Classy.
[ponies chattering]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Here we are, the stars of the show!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: You may tell us how much you loved it now.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Line forms here!
<b>Spike</b>: Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: <i>Would</i> have?
<b>Spike</b>: They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Even Rainbow Dash?
<b>Spike</b>: Yeah. Rarity fell <i>way</i> behind.
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: Aww.
<b>Spike</b>: Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.
[ponies chattering]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting?
<b>Lemon Hearts</b>: Oh my, I- I loved the dresses.
<b>Noteworthy</b>: I liked some of those lines you said.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh, really? Which ones?
<b>Noteworthy</b>: Uh, I don't really remember, but you were 
wearing a pink taffeta dress with lots of chiffon when you said them! 
Whoo-ee, that outfit was a dazzler!
<b>Lemon Hearts</b>: I liked that one almost as much as the one with the lacy trim and all the embroidered cuffs! [chuckles]
<b>Noteworthy</b>: That was a nice one too!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [growls] Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play <i>besides</i> the dresses?!
<b>Crowd</b>: [general excuses]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [noise of frustration]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: All of this is one headpiece?
<b>Rarity</b>: Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the crème
 de la crème of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden 
stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big 
bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!
[door opens and closes]
<b>Rarity</b>: Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Not even close.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!
<b>Applejack</b>, <b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!
<b>Applejack</b>: Right behind ya!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: How could you?! "Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, <i>dresses</i>!"
[pause]
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, so they did like them. [chuckles] You had me worried, you silly filly.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: There! I knew it! You did this on 
purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth 
birthday party all over again!
<b>Rarity</b>: The... the what now?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!
<b>Rarity</b>: Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then--
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!
<b>Rarity</b>: I thought they were supposed to be good.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!
<b>Rarity</b>: I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: <i>Ha!</i>
[door slams]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I
 put up with all week long! [imitating Rarity] "Sweetie Belle, get me 
some red ribbon! No, that's not red, that's <i>cherry</i>! No, that's not red, that's <i>cinnamon</i>!" [normal, muffled] For Pete's sake, it's <i>all</i> red!
<b>Rarity</b>: [to Opalescence] I should probably go talk to her, hm?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't 
be all like "Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care 
about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red 
ribbon!"
<b>Rarity</b>: Perhaps waiting would be best.
[bedclothes rustling]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ughhh! Hgh, hgh, hgh! Nnngh! [growls] Now I can't even sleep! Happy now, big sis? [growls]
[tap running]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gulping water] I wish there was a way I could take back all the work I did!
<b>Rarity</b>: [snoring]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Even better. [giggles sinisterly]
[muffled ponies chattering]
[camera clicking]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [growls] Now what?
[ponies cheering]
<b>Eclair Crème</b>: And the winner of the "Best Writer, 
Director, Actor in an Awesome Play Put on by a Pony and Her Awesome Best
 Friends" goes to...
<b>"Star Gazer"</b>: Sweetie Belle!
[crowd chattering and cheering]
[cameras clicking]
[lightning cracks]
[ponies in distress]
[Wilhelm scream]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Don't go!
<b>Rarity</b>: [evil laugh]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Stop! Why do you have to ruin <i>everything</i>?!
<b>Rarity</b>: [growls]
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Enough!
<b>Rarity</b>: [whimpers]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming?
<b>Princess Luna</b>: What do you think?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: I understand what you're going through, 
Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than 
me, and with this, I have struggled.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!
[series of thuds]
[foals cheering]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I remember this. This is my fifth 
birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all 
beautiful, just like my big sister.
[thud]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Finally, I was perfect, and then went to 
the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out 
of my room, I found the party going on without me.
[foals cheering]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was...
<b>"Mint Flower"</b>: These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]
<b>Little Pony 2</b>: Awesome! Where did you get these?
<b>Rarity</b>: Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
[foals cheering]
<b>Little Pony 2</b>: You're the greatest, Rarity!
<b>"Plum Star"</b>: Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?
<b>Younger Sweetie Belle</b>: [sniffling]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I thought you said you understood? Luna?
[stomp]
<b>Little Pony 2</b>: Where's Sweetie Belle?
<b>Rarity</b>: I'm sure she'll be along in any moment.
<b>"Titania"</b>: [yawns] I'm tired of waiting. I say we get 
out of here before we all keel over from boredom. Who's with me? Poor 
Sweetie Belle. Nopony's gonna come to another one of her parties after <i>this</i> fiasco.
<b>Rarity</b>: Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but...
<b>"Mint Flower"</b>: These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]
<b>Little Pony 2</b>: Awesome? Where did you get these?
<b>Rarity</b>: Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
[foals cheering]
<b>"Plum Star"</b>: Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?
<b>Younger Sweetie Belle</b>: [sniffling]
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna!
[splash]
[dolphins squeaking]
<b>Rarity</b>: Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: When was this?
<b>Rarity</b>: But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight!
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. 
You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now 
is a good night's rest.
[click]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Hm. How curious you should say that.
[door opens]
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did.
<b>Rarity</b>: And here it is! The crème de la crème--
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Noooo!
<b>Rarity</b>: The piéce de resistance...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Don't! [gasps]
<b>Backup dancers</b>: [oohing] [gasping]
<b>Rarity</b>: The headdress!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Looks like I made a mistake here.
<b>Rarity</b>: But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: You sure about that, honey?
<b>Rarity</b>: Please, you must believe me!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Listen to my sister!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b> and <b>Backup dancers</b>: [laughing]
<b>Rarity</b>: [crying]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [screams] I don't wanna see any more!
<b>Rarity</b>: Always check and recheck!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Who all wants to hear a funny story about my <i>ex-</i>costume designer?
[ponies laughing]
<b>Rarity</b>: Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Make me a dress, Rarity, please?
<b>Rarity</b>: Go away! You know I don't do that anymore!
[door slams]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Wake me up, Princess Luna, wake me up, wake me uuuup!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasping]
[door opens]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! She left for Canterlot!
[train engine noises]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: If we're not too late already.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: 'Get Your Pony On'!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Ooh, that's one of my favorites!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: 'Serves Her Right'!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: ...I prefer show tunes.
<b>Scootaloo </b>and <b>Apple Bloom</b>: Ugh.
[pounding music]
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Five, six, seven eight, ba-bam!
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: One more time, from the top. Let's not embarrass me in front of my favorite designer this time? And a-one, two, three, four!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But you <i>have</i> to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You <i>have</i> to believe us!
<b>Security guard</b>: Kid, the only thing I have to do is make sure Sapphire Shores doesn't get interrupted all day by fans like you.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But I'm not a fan!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I am!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Me too!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Not helping!
<b>Backup dancers</b>: [panting]
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Now, <i>that's</i> how I like it! You 
rocked it, girls! Get some water and be back in ten. Rar-i-ty, come on 
up here and show me what you brought me. Sapphire wants to see it and to
 love it!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [straining] Almost...
[crash]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oof!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We've gotta get in there, now!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Okay then. Liking what I see so far. So is this the whole shebang?
<b>Rarity</b>: Actually, I saved the best for last!
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [screaming]
<b>Rarity</b>: And here it is!
[thudding]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!
<b>Rarity</b>: Sweetie Belle?!
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: You know her?
<b>Rarity</b>: Uh... [laughs nervously] Ahem. Just a moment!
[door opens]
[crash]
[door closes]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh, good! This is just a dream!
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Actually, no. This is very much real.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [sighs] Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do?
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it.
[door opens]
<b>Rarity</b>: I would like to know what in the wide, wide 
realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know 
now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Actually, I do. I was upset at you for 
stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center 
stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart.
<b>Rarity</b>: What?!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But then I realized I didn't want your 
future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before
 it was too late! So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me.
<b>Rarity</b>: Wait... what is <i>this</i>?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it.
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Rarity, this isn't going to work out. 
You don't get to my level of success without learning to read the signs,
 and this situation has bad luck written all over it.
<b>Rarity</b>: I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: My, it is attractive, but...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Look at the stitching, real close.
<b>Sapphire Shores</b>: Well, I'll be. It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams.
<b>Rarity</b>: Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm
 sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only 
trying to help.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part.
<b>Rarity</b>: Awww!
