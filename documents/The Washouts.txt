[bang, bang, bang] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club! 
[fans murmuring excitedly] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: First order of business – [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?! 
[bang] 
[confused murmuring] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Meeting adjourned! 
[door slams] 
[bang, bang] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club – of which I am the president, founding, and only member – the Washouts Fan Club! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] 
[door opens] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor— Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey! What are you doin' here? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I could ask 
 <i>you</i> the same question! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for 
 <i>every</i> meeting! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, sure it 
 <i>sounds</i> weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I just think maybe it's time for me to explore 
 <i>other</i> fan clubs. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] What is a "The Washouts"? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Stunt troupe? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: "Twenty bajillion"?! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: "Boring old flight and formation junk"?! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Are you just repeating everything I say? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So you 
 <i>do</i> get it! Aren't they awesome?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Can you believe she actually said that?! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting 
 <i>is</i> kinda weird. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think 
 <i>I</i> was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why don't you find out? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow! They 
 <i>do</i> look pretty amazing... uh, -ly 
 <i>un</i>amazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nice save, Twilight! [squee] 
[crowd chattering] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Awww. I 
 <i>knew</i> we shoulda lined up last night. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm sorry for making us late. Who would've guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long time to bake? [slurps, chomps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on. 
[bang, bang] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically 
 <i>invented</i> sitting on bleachers! 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ugh! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And look at that! Popcorn 
 <i>and</i> cotton candy?! Ripoff! 
[feedback] 
[music] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh! 
<b>Announcer</b>: 
 <i>This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!</i> 
[crowd cheers] 
[explosions] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, yeah! 
<b>Announcer</b>: 
 <i>Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto...</i> 
<b>Announcer</b> and 
 <b>Crowd</b>: Leap before you look! 
[crowd cheers] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Woo-hoo! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lame. 
<b>Fanpony</b>: Oh! 
<b>Announcer</b>: 
 <i>Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!</i> 
[kaboom!] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it! 
[clang!] 
[crowd gasps] 
[crowd cheers] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That... was... 
 <i>insane!</i> Woo-hoo! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I told you! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't just go up and talk to them. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe. 
[water splashing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey! 
[beat] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt. 
<b>Short Fuse</b> and 
 <b>Rolling Thunder</b>: [laugh] 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: [Australian accent] Ha! Join the club. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [excited noises] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: O... kay... 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: No. I mean, literally. Join the club. We're called "The Washouts" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just like you. Heh. Until we "washed out". 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way! 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of "flagrant disregard for hazardous weather". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I don't wanna be right. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Cool! 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse. 
<b>Short Fuse</b>: Ah, nice to meet you. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's your story? 
<b>Short Fuse</b>: 
 <big><i>ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!</i></big> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader? 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Lightning Dust! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snarls] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, "lack of brains"! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: [snarls] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Your "friend" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh. That's, uh, less cool. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, well, I'm still— 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger 
 <i>these</i> knuckleheads. 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b> and 
 <b>Short Fuse</b>: [laugh] 
<b>Short Fuse</b>: [through gritted teeth] Don't call me "Knucklehead"! [laughs] 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Really? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Only because when 
 <i>I</i> went, I cranked up the dizziness factor. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b> and 
 <b>Lightning Dust</b>: [laugh] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: [to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, we do have safety rules for a reason. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Don't listen to her, kid. All their "rules" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while. 
<b>Rolling Thunder</b>: Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I'll do it! Can I do it?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, lemme think. No! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [scoffs] I wasn't asking 
 <i>you</i>! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And also, 
 <i>no!</i> 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's it! You're comin' with me! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Where are we going? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Say hi to Spitfire for me! 
[Wonderbolts theme] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yawns] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You... 
 <i>What?!</i> [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about. 
<b>Spitfire</b>: I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Patent pending? 
<b>Spitfire</b>: You end up in a 
 <i>full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!</i> 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But with enough practice— 
<b>Spitfire</b>: Practice?! Well, la-dee-
 <i>doodle-dah!</i> Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, "I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and 
 <i>stunt</i> some 
 <i>tricks</i> with my new friend 
 <i>Lightning Dust</i>!" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play 
 <i>that</i> game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to "stunt tricks" in a 
 <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!</span></i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think she gets the poi— 
<b>Spitfire</b>: 
 <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not finished!</span></i> Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, "I'm gonna touch the sky!" 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't— 
<b>Spitfire</b>: Well, whoop-dee-
 <i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">doodle-doo!</span></i> You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a 
 <i><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!</span></b></i> 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [shakily] Uh-huh... 
<b>Spitfire</b>: Excellent. Have a hat. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: More like "follow your wingflaps". 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Same difference. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what 
 <i>I</i> should do. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me? 
[clatter] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding. 
[blow dryer blowing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, "Wow, she's so humble!" Ya think? Scootaloo? 
[door opens] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, Scootaloo? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Anypony seen Scootalo— 
[bump!] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I— Twilight? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans] Sorry. I was just... um... 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They were doing an autograph session before practice. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually... 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if 
 <i>that</i> happens. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot. 
[clanging] 
<b>Short Fuse</b>: Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] 
 <big><i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!</span></i></big> 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich. 
<b>Short Fuse</b>: 
 <big><i><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not signing that abomination!</span></i></big> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: [laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't need you standing up for me! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast 
 <i><b><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">drinkin' through a straw!</span></b></i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That doesn't even sound like Spitfire. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's it! We're leaving! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to 
 <i>be</i> you! But based on 
 <i>your</i> definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll 
 <i>never</i> be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That was awfully specific. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Good! Because I already have! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] 
[crowd chattering] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sorry for making us late again. Who would've guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've been super-difficult to bake? [chomps] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] 
<b>Announcer</b>: 
 <i>And here to introduce the most dangerous stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain, L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!</i> 
[crowd cheers] 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky. 
[crowd gasps] 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite! 
[crowd cheers] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you "ma'am"? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Wow. That sure is... 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Has anypony tested it before? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Where's the fun in that? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps] 
[tape stretching] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: There's m-more?! 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: You're not thinking of backing out, are you? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Are you the president of my fan club or not? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Of course! It's just— 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I... Is that a thing? 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Light it up! 
[flames roaring] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Okay. Now I 
 <i>am</i> thinking about backing out. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: Too late! 
[rockets roaring] 
[crowd cheering] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [whimpering] 
[crowd gasps] 
[whoosh!] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time. 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof. 
[snap!] 
<b>Lightning Dust</b>: RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wouldn't have it any other way! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's 
 <i>not</i> the kind of pony I wanna look up to. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: 
 <i>I'm</i> the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: The Rainbow Dash Fan Club! 
[bang, bang, bang] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club! 
[fans cheering] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.
