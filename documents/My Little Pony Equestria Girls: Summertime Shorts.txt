<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I just don't know! There are so many splendiferous things I could paint, but I'm drawing a blank! 
<b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: You just need to find some inspiration, that's all. Get those creative juices flowing. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're absolutely right, Sunset Shimmer! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [slurps] 
[pause] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Still no ideas. Are you sure that these are the 
 <i>creative</i> juices? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sunset Shimmer said that all the greatest artists find inspiration in nature. Maybe this will help me think of something. [sighs] 
[pause] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Nope. 
[birds chirping] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooooh! You birdies are right! I have to get even

<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [stops tapping] What? Oh! No. But I 
 <i>do</i> have a tummy full of fruit juice, feathers in my hair, and a headache! Heh. 
<b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Well, when all else fails, I usually just paint a subject that I think is awesome. Something that makes me really happy. Like these bright sunflowers. 
[whimsical music] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Of course! I've got it! It's been right in front of me all along! 
[music] 
[paint splattering] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Woooo-hoo-hoo! [giggling] Yeah! 
[splash!] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: When you said to paint a subject that's totally awesome and makes me happy, I thought of something right away! Ta-da! I painted 
 <i>you</i>, Sunset! 
<b>Sunset Shimmer</b>: Yes, Pinkie. Yes, you did.

<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh. Looks like we're a little too early. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [sigh] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aah! Thank jellybeans you three are here! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Is everything okay, Pinkie Pie? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No! It's Gummy! He's... missing! 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [gasp] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I brought him here to see the 
 <i>Daring Do</i> movie again because it's his favorite. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Ours, too! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I love the part when Daring Do swings in on the vine and defeats the band of howler monkeys before breaking into the volcano fortress! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: So what happened to Gummy? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! I went to buy some candy and some more candy, and poof! He was gone! You haven't seen him? 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Mm-mm. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? A missin' pet? A friend in distress? This sounds like a job for the CMC!
