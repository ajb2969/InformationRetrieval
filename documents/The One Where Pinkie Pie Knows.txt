<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... Phew! Look at  <i>that</i>, Pound Cake! I am  <i>so</i> close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pretty impressive if I do say so myself. 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special order, and the ingredients need to be perfect. 
<b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [squeals] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okie-dokie-lokie. 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Thanks, dear! 
[zip] 
[thud] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?! [squeals] This is the best news ever! I can't wait to tell Twilight! 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Oh, em, Pinkie, uh... [whispers] it's a top secret surprise. 
<b>Mrs. Cake </b>and  <b>Pumpkin Cake</b>: [prolonged shushing] 
[door closes] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news... [gulps] ...to myself! <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Even though I didn't  <i>technically</i> make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs. Cake, I can't tell Twilight or  <i>anypony</i> the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy? 
<b>Gummy</b>: [sucking on pacifier] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby? 
<b>Rarity</b>: What's all this about a baby? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?! 
<b>Rarity</b>: You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about? 
[pop] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sucking on pacifier] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting everything ready! 
[main cast chattering] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor and Princess Cadance! 
[beat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, and they're coming— 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Tomorrow! 
[beat] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes, on the— 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Friendship Express rather than the Crystal Empire train so as not to cause too much of a scene when they skip town to come visit? [squee] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yes. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Annnnnd? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And that's it. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, how did  <i>you</i> know all that? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] Uh... Pinkie Sense? 
[stretching noise] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, you said you needed our help with something? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Follow me. <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Surprise?! [nervous laugh] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Aww, look at the cute little ant farm! 
[ant screeches] 
<b>Spike</b>: And check out all these old comic books! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Be careful! They're mint-in-bag! 
<b>Spike</b>: [blowing] [nervous whistling] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's this? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! [nervous laugh] Really cute! [nervous laugh] 
<b>Rarity</b>: It is a bit juvenile for castle décor, but it is very sweet of you. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm sure Shining Armor will love it. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it. 
<b>Rest of main cast sans Twilight</b>: [various agreements] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:  <i>Totally</i> understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might  <i>explode</i>?! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I would say... no. 
<b>Rarity</b>: The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt  <i>forever</i>! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] Gotta bounce! 
[pinball noises] 
[crash] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual? [zoom] 
[door shuts] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be  <i>really</i> hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Oh, good, you're back! Mrs. Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I... did? <b>Mr. Cake</b>: Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'll do it! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Really? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye! <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [deflates, sighs] Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony! [cart squeaking] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hiya, Pinkie Pie! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Heard any good gossip today? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope! 
[thump] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh! Fluttershy, what a surprise! I mean,  <i>not</i> a surprise! [squee] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You know, maybe some baby carrots... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [nervous laugh] What did you say?! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter and— Albino squirrel! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Where? Is it Albert? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary! 
[cart squeaking] [knocking] 
[door opens] 
[zoom] 
[sewing machine clicking] 
[light splashing] <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just  <i>one</i> little pony the surprise? 
<b>Rarity</b>: [with reverb]  <i>The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!</i> 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I can't tell anypony at all! [sighs] Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault. <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney. 
[paper rustling] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wow, great idea! I'm starving too! [chewing] [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises  <i>today</i>! And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately... [balloons squeaking] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ooh! I want a flamingo! 
[balloons squeaking] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I want a goldfish! 
[balloons squeaking] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Surprise me! 
[balloons squeaking] 
[baby crying] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Is that a... baby bottle? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [screams] No! It's a... a... puppy! Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha! Eh... 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Are you sure? Because it  <i>looks</i> like a— 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Next! 
<b>Featherweight</b>: Uh, a baby pony, please! Uh, unless of course that would be a royal pain... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Interesting choice of words, Featherweight. 
<b>Featherweight</b>: Was it? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't know. Was it? 
<b>Featherweight</b>: Uh, maybe you'd better just make me a giraffe. [filing cabinets closing] 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: My, your friends weren't kidding when they said you had a great filing system, Pinkie! You are Ponyville's best kept secret! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, I'm not! 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: [hushed] Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret? 
[papers rustling] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Noooooo... 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: [hushed] A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope! 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: [strangled sigh] Me neither... [balloon inflating] 
<b>"Wooden Legs"</b>: [laughing] That's just what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're welcome! 
<b>"Wooden Legs"</b>: Oh, by the way, can you help spread the word about the big crib sale I'm having? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [reading] "Treat your foal like... royalty"?! 
[thump] 
<b>"Wooden Legs"</b>: [laughing] Pretty good slogan, huh? I came up with it all by myself! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [screaming] 
<b>"Wooden Legs"</b>: Oh. I thought it was clever. 
[balloon deflates] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>Whaaaaaaaaaat?!</i> [hyperventilating] You mean... [breathes] I have... [breathes] to wait... [breathes] another whole day?! I don't know if I can! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [inarticulate yell] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: We're here to listen. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, go on then, sugarcube. 
<b>Rarity</b>: We're not going to judge you, darling. 
<b>Spike</b>: You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [blowing up balloon] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on. 
[balloon pops] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whatever it is, you can tell us! We're best friends! [with reverb]  <i>Friends! Friends! Friends!</i> 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [with reverb] Tell! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b> and  <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [with reverb]  <i>Tell! Tell!</i> 
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>Friends! Friends! Friends! Tell! Tell! Tell!</i> 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, okay, you win! [inhales] Shining Armor and Cadance are gonna have a— 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: An awesome weekend with the best little sister in all of Equestria! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [giggles] Hi, everypony. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [exhales] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor, Cadance! You're early! I thought something had come up and you weren't gonna make it until Saturday! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until  <i>next</i> week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Surprise! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: It's wonderful to see you all again! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>,  <b>Rainbow Dash</b> and  <b>Rarity</b>: [chattering] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm so glad you're here! I have a big surprise for you! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Oh, yeah? <b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [chattering] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [hushed] Lucky we came when we did, huh? I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake? Hey, I'm impressed you've been able to keep our secret  <i>this</i> long! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So you're gonna tell Twilight now?! 
[honk] 
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Princess Cadance</b>: [chattering] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [hushed] You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It'd better be. <b>Applejack</b>: So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Didn't you see him? He couldn't stop raving about it! <b>Shining Armor</b>: [excited horse noises] <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us? [stomach rumbling] I'm  <i>starving</i>! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [through gritted teeth] They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nothiiiiiiing! 
[zoom] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly  <i>right now</i>! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's this? [gasps] 
<b>Rarity</b>: What does it say? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a big prize, like a new book, or several new books, or— 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We get the picture! You like books! 
<b>Applejack</b>: So what's the first clue? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I hope it's something about eating lunch! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [reading quickly] "You've got a scroll, you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their week? A piece of paper will continue this caper." 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got it! "Where the young ones spend their week." 
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm not quite followin'. [school bell ringing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Good enough for me! Now where's the next clue? [panting like a dog] [sniffing] [sneezes] 
<b>Featherweight</b>: Extra, extra! Get your Ponyville news! Read it in the paper! Extra, extra! [continues repeating under] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "A piece of paper will continue this caper." [gasps] It's in the  <i>Foal Free Press</i>! 
[paper rustling] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report! Why, it's stunning! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh, didn't  <i>you</i> make that, Rarity? 
<b>Rarity</b>: Yes, what is your point? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>Focus, everypony!</i> 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You know, there's really no time limit on these scavenger hunts, Pinkie. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aha! There! [tapping paper] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "Though this hall is rather small, in it you'll find files of all kinds. Take a look on the back of the birth certificate of Applejack." 
<b>Applejack</b>: I don't like where this is goin'. [zoom] 
[knee-knocking noises] 
<b>Mayor Mare</b>: Baby! A  <i>royal ba—</i>! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A- <i>hem</i>? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Does anypony know where the birth certificates are kept? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know! [folders rustling] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, you're so cute. 
<b>Fluttershy</b> and  <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [giggling] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [reading] "This next place is where you can buy a table or chair, or some comfy beds to rest little heads"? 
[zip] 
[beat] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh, really? None of you? [groan]  <i>It's obviously the furniture store!</i> Go in, go in, go in! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Daagh, fine! 
[rumbling and commotion] 
[crash] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow, you're scary good at this, Pinkie Pie. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [reading quickly] "It seems we've saved the best for last. We hope that you have had a blast. Now it's time to take a break where you can get a slice of cake!" 
<b>Main cast sans Pinkie Pie</b>: Sugarcube Corner! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [scoffs] That was an easy one. [door opens, bell rings] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Surprise! Twily, did you like the scavenger hunt? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It was perfect! Just like old times, except even better because this time I got to share it with my best friends! There's just one thing missing, isn't there? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: What's that? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mmmm, the book prize at the end! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [laughs] There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. I don't understand. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles quietly] 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: All the places we sent you today had something in common. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: First we went to the schoolhouse... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [trembling] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And then we read the  <i>Foal Free Press</i>... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib. 
<b>Pound and Pumpkin Cake</b>: [giggling] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib... [gasps] Can it be? Are you two...?! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b> and  <b>Shining Armor</b>: We're having a  <i>baby</i>! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A baby, Twilight! It's a baby! Woo-hoo! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean... I'm going to be an aunt?! This is the best prize ever! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b> and  <b>Shining Armor</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, I love you guys! And I can't wait to meet your little foal! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Neither can we. 
[chattering] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it! [squee] [pop] Go, Pinkie. [chattering] 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [giggles] You did it, Pinkie Pie! You kept it a surprise! Thank you! Was it much trouble? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Piece of cake! [squee] [credits]
