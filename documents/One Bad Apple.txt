<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [whining] What to wear, what to wear? Oh, what to wear?! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Too casual. Too summery. 
<b>Applejack</b>: [sigh] Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from  <i>Manehattan</i>. I wanna make a good impression! 
<b>Applejack</b>: You know what would make a good impression? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: What? 
<b>Applejack</b>:  <i>Bein' on time to pick her up</i>! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [whining] 
<b>Applejack</b>: You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [muffled, through snorkel] Oh, yeah? What's that? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Neither of you have your cutie mark. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: What?! How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I– 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh, this changes everything! Meet you at the train station! I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo! 
<b>Applejack</b>: You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here! <b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Do you really think she'll wanna join? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I'm just so excited I could burst! 
[train whistle blows] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Is that the train from Manehattan? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Yep. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: That's her! Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her. Oh! No, tha-tha-that's her! Um, no. Oh, wait, tha– that's not her either, uh... 
<b>Applejack</b>: Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Oh... [laughs nervously] Yeah. 
[train lets off steam] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Ah, that's her! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Babs! Babs! It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom! And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so,  <i>so</i> glad you're here! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Thanks, I'm happy to– 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: This is gonna be the best week of your life! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Sure hope it's gonna be– 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Seriously, we are gonna have a  <i>blast</i>. 
<b>Applejack</b>: [laughs] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Really? I've never been on a float before. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: And we've got a really big surprise for you! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Yeah... uh... a surprise? <b>Apple Bloom</b>: I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: The Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Technically, we're its  <i>only</i> members. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: I do? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Oh, yeah... [blows] That... 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us. 
[poik] 
[squeak] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: This is where we do our role call... 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [squeaks] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: This is where we eat our lunch... 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [munching] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas. 
[ding] 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Yeah, uh... 
[pause] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Uh, could you excuse us for a moment? 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Sure... 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] Thought she'd be more impressed. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [hushed] She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her! 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Hmmmm. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] [hushed] The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: Mm-hmm. <b>Apple Bloom</b>: Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: [laughs nervously] 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: More like  <i>funny</i>... 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b> and  <b>Silver Spoon</b>: ... <i>looking</i>! [laughing] 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: What  <i>is</i> that thing, a giant  <i>orange</i>? 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b> and  <b>Silver Spoon</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: It's a pumpkin. 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: More like a lame-kin. 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: [laughs] 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Who's the new blank flank? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you. 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The [mockingly] Cutie Mark Crusaders? 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: [blows] More like the Cutie Mahk  <i>Crybabies</i>! [derisive chuckle] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>:  <i>Hey</i>!! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Oooo, heh, big city attitude! I like it! 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: Mm-hmm! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Oh, yeah? Well there's more where that came from! Check this out! [grunts] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh no, she didn't! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>,  <b>Silver Spoon</b>, and  <b>Babs Seed</b>: [laughs] 
[creaking, rolling, crashing] 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed! 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b> and  <b>Silver Spoon</b>: [laughs] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: When ah tell Applejack– 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: You gonna tell Applejack what? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: W-well, y'know, uh... 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: What're you, a snitch? 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: What... just happened? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I think Babs just went to the dark side. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We have to tell Applejack! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: No! We're  <i>not</i> snitches! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah! And we're not  <i>babies</i>! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Then... why do I feel like crying? <b>Scootaloo</b>: I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [sighs] What are we gonna do? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're gonna build a new float, that's what. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [sighs] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We could always tell Applejack. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: [echoing] What are you, a snitch? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and  <b>Scootaloo</b>: No! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [groans] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales! Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Avoid her.

[Pinkie's polka begins playing in background] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [gasp] By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Yeah! Wait, what? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [laughs under her breath] When you look up 'embarrassed' in the dictionary... [deep breath] Her face will be there! <b>Babs Seed</b>: [snoring] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Moo! Moo! 
[cow chewing] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Moo! Moo! 
[squeaking] 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Aheh... [resumes snoring] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are those from the Carousel Boutique? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yup. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Excellent. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [blows] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ooh! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the  <i>thing</i> from the  <i>place</i>? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What's that? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Granny Smith's kitchen timer. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: What's that for? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sing-song voice] You'll see! [giggles] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it! [A-Team-like music] 
[scissors cutting] 
[hammering] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [yawns] Is this it? 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [tired] I think... we're a go. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [tired] Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho! [Pinkie's polka plays in background] 
<b>"Roma"</b>: Hot carrot crêpes! Get 'em here, get 'em hot!

<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Ow! 
[motor running] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You had your chance.

<b>Babs Seed</b>: See ya later, Cutie Mark  <i>Crybabies</i>! 
[door slams] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [hushed] The timer set? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [giggling] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan. 
[pop] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Heartache? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: T-t-t-teased? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: B-Bullies?! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed. 
[balloons deflating] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So  <i>that's</i> why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to  <i>be</i> a bully instead! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And now  <i>we've</i> turned into bullies too! 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: What do we do?! [crowd cheering] 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Nice float, Babs. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks. 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Too cool for mule, Babs. 
<b>Mule</b>: [brays] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We gotta stop that float! 
[kitchen timer ticking] 
[band playing very loudly] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [almost inaudible] Applejack, quick you have to– 
<b>Applejack</b>: Huh? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [almost inaudible] Quick, you have to help us– 
<b>Applejack</b>: What? 
[band stops] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We booby-trapped it! 
[pause] 
[band suddenly starts again] 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float! 
[kitchen timer ticking] 
<b>Spectator</b>: Oof, my popcorn! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sorry! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: 'Scuse me! Ah, whoops. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Whoa! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Pinkie Pie, let us in! ("lettuce in") 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Funny joke! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: No, really!  <i>Let- us- in</i>! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ohhh! Here! 
[tires screeching] 
[ponies panicking] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Babs! You gotta get out of that float! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: You're not getting your float back,  <i>crybabies</i>! 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: But it's booby tra– 
[thud] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Veggie salad! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Huh? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>Veggie salad</i>! 
[crash] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] Veggie salad. [munching] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Seriously? 
[engine driving away] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! Don't leave me! [laughs]  <i>Leaf</i> me! [laughs] 
[kitchen timer ticking] 
[kitchen timer ringing] 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: What the– 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Babs! Babs! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Oof! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [yelling] Oooh, sweet applesauce! 
[thud] 
[squelch] 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [groans of pain] 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time. 
[camera clicking] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Are y'all okay? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Yeah... we're fine. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: No sweat. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: After I'd been so mean to ya... you saved me! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [sighs] About that... <b>Babs Seed</b>: I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake! 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Except...  <i>we</i> were the reason it was headed into the lake. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: We booby trapped the float. 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully... 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan. 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then...  <i>we</i> were the ones being bullies. And... Oh,  <i>why does life have to be so ironic</i>?! 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Guess what we're trying to say is... 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: We're sorry. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: [blows] I'm sorry too. 
<b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] Y'know,  <i>this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning.</i> 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: That's what  <i>I</i> kept on saying! 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: So... can we... start over? 
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Definitely. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah. [Scootaloo playing timpani] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: "We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..." 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [clears throat] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Well  <i>you</i> wrote this. 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, uh, yeah... 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: "Homegirl... Amiga..." Blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, yes, here. "...and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes... boss-om buddies... compadres..." 
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Congratulations! [quickly, under her breath] Gotta remember to revise that. 
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [laughing] 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: [blows] <b>Apple Bloom</b>: So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right? 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Yeah,  <i>and</i> I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear? 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks. 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends! 
<b>Silver Spoon</b>: F-friends? 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Yeah, you got a problem with that? 
<b>Diamond Tiara</b>: Well, what if I do? What are  <i>you</i> gonna do about it? 
<b>Babs Seed</b>: Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes! 
[splat] 
[pig grunts] 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I'm sure gonna miss that  <i>bad</i> seed. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now? 
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in  <i>actually</i> a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good. Get it? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Yea... No.
