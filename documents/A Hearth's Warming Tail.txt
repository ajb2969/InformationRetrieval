<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville? 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I was thinking I might just skip it. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b> and  <b>Spike</b>: [gasp] <b>Spike</b>: Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it? 
<b>Spike</b>: And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I  <i>think</i> what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history. 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story. 
[magic zap] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe you just haven't heard the  <i>right</i> Hearth's Warming Eve story yet! 
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not that one. My favorite holiday story, "A Hearth's Warming Tale"! 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, I love that one! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot... <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded.  <i>Almost</i>, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation— 
<b>Spike</b>: [narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time. 
[bells ringing] 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: [gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant. 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: What do you need? 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration! 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: [under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get  <i>that</i> crazy idea? 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria. 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos! 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that "singing songs and being nice" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works. 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: I think you might be missing the point. 
[magic zap] 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria.

<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Sweet!

<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often: our friends. 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Wow. 
[rip] 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks? 
<span title="as Snowfall Frost" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Starlight Glimmer</b></span>: I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time. 
<span title="as Snowdash" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog!
