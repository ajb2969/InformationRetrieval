<b>Fluttershy</b>: La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Gah! 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [sniff] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you  <i>were</i> hungry. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You're the cutest thing  <i>ever</i>! I can't wait to show you to my friends. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself. 
<b>Spike</b>: It also didn't mess itself up. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow! 
<b>Spike</b>: I thought this was just an unofficial  <i>casual</i> visit. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter. 
<b>Spike</b>: Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around. 
<b>Spike</b>: You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming. 
<b>Spike</b>: Or maybe I should... [groan] [ponies chatter] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What happened to the rest of her name? 
<b>Golden Harvest</b>: We couldn't fit it all in. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess  <i>Celest</i>". Take it down and try again. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>That</i> looks perfect. Keep up the good work. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming? 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: Uh...it would be coming a little better if... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mmm... [slurp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Pinkie</i>! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a  <i>king</i>, or a  <i>queen</i>, or a  <i>princess</i>. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] [chirp] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasp] Three? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: They're  <i>amazing</i>. What are they? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so...  <i>adorable</i>. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Pinkie, do you want the other one? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh! A parasprite?  <i>Are you kidding</i>? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>:  <i>Ugh</i>? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A para- <i>what</i>? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: How could you not like... 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh. Now I gotta go find a  <i>trombone</i>. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: A  <i>what</i>? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A trombone, you know: [trombone imitation] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ahhh, typical Pinkie. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] <b>Rarity</b>: Stand still, Rainbow Dash. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh, I  <i>caaan't</i>, I need to  <i>flyyy</i>! This is waaay too boring for me. 
<b>Rarity</b>:  <i>Do</i> you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know  <i>someone</i> appreciates my talents. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh,  <i>sooo boooring</i>. 
<b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Huh? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What's that sound, Twilight? 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [several chirps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wow, what are they? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I'll take one. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Me too, oh, they're perfect. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Does anypony know where I can find an accordion? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>,  <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, and  <b>Rarity</b>: [baby noises] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Girls!  <i>Hello</i>! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow. 
<b>Spike</b>: [snore] 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [baby noises] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about? <b>Parasprites</b>: [loud baby noises] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! Wake up! What happened? 
<b>Spike</b>: Huh? Whaaa! What's going on? 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where did they come from? 
<b>Spike</b>: I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The princess will be here in a few hours. 
<b>Spike</b>: Ugh. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, help me round up these little guys. 
<b>Spike</b>: Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around". <b>Parasprite</b>: [several chirps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Huh? Huh?! [screech] [grunt] [groan] Get off me! [groan] [grunt] Waaa! <b>Rarity</b>: Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [purr] [grunt] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp]  <i>Eewww</i>. Aaah! Gross gross  <i>gross</i>! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique! 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [grunt] [pop] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [screech] <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica. [plays harmonica] Isn't that great? 
<b>Parasprites</b>: [chirping] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] And not a moment too soon. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And I'm  <i>not</i>? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find?  <i>A lot</i>, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time. 
<b>Rarity</b>:  <i>Please</i>, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a  <i>real</i> problem. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [gasp] I see we're having the same problem. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ditto! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fluttershy knows  <i>everything</i> about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying. 
<b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...or not. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and... 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Guh. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whine] <b>Princess Celestia</b>: [scream] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster. 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [hack] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: What do we do? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest. 
<b>Applejack</b>: [scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Aye aye. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Yeeeeeee-haw! 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [screech] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight, we don't have much time. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some  <i>maracas</i>. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing  <i>maracas</i>. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie, you are so  <i>random</i>. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And you are all so stubborn! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out. <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All  <i>right</i>! [grunt] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Ouch. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We did it. Nice work, Applejack. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Couldn't a'done it without y'all. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where did they come from? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We call in the weather patrol. [grunts] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [shriek] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA! 
<b>Parasprites</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Looks like our problems are solved. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: They will be with these cymbals. [crash] Hey! Give me those back! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, what have you done? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin- <i>ee</i>! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and  <i>listen to me</i>! <b>Parasprites</b>: [chirps] [munch] [munch] 
<b>Pony</b>: [gasp] 
<b>Gardening pony</b>: Aah! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: What do we do? They're eating all the food in town. 
<b>Applejack</b>: [gasp] My apples! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We've gotta do something. [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Look, tambourines! If you could all just... [scream] [tambourines shake] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [chirp] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sigh] 
<b>Parasprite</b>: [munch] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the  <i>food</i> anymore. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh no... if they get inside my store...  <i>Everypony for herself</i>! <b>Rarity</b>: My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>:  <i>I'll save you</i>! 
[recorder] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [shriek] <b>Applejack</b>: No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop. 
[parasprites buzzing] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Brace yourself, y'all, here they come. [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'. <b>Spike</b>: Help! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasp] They're eating the  <i>words</i>. [grunts] 
<b>Spike</b>: Help... <b>Zecora</b>: Ugh. Have you gone mad? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please? 
<b>Zecora</b>: Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know! Is it? 
<b>Zecora</b>: Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gulp] <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts] Oh no, here she comes. 
[ponies scream] 
<b>Daisy</b>: Aaaah, aaaaaaah! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: YAAAA! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there.  <i>We've got less than a minute</i>. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over! 
[polka music] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense? <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Look. 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hello, princess. 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends. 
[crash] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They're not  <i>that</i> adorable. 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade. 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of  <i>infestation</i>. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: An... infestation? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trouble? What trouble? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: My... report? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Haven't you learned anything about friendship? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Actually, I have.  <i>I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...</i> 
[cymbals crash] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Even when they don't always seem to make sense.</i> 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you, princess. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, what happened to the princess? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Emergency in Fillydelphia. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Some sort of  <i>infestation</i>. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think the princess can handle it. 
<b>Applejack</b>: So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I  <i>tried</i> to tell you. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen. 
[ <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm sorry, Pinkie.] [ <b>Rarity</b>: So sorry, Pinkie.] [ <b>Fluttershy</b>: Sorry, Pinkie.] [ <b>Applejack</b>: Real sorry, Pinkie.] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when  <i>I</i> don't understand me. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: ...Or not.
