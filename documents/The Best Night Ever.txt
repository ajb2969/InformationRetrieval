<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie! Please stop shouting, I'm trying to concentrate. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What's Twilight doing? 
<b>Spike</b>: She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Where are the others? It's getting late. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hold your horses, girl. We're here. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Perfect! I'm ready. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: For what? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All right, Spike. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: An apple! Are we having pie? 
<b>Spike</b>: Shh! Watch! 
[collective: Awesome! Wow! Lovely!] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks. But that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You have my word. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ta-da! 
[collective: Oh. Uh. Ah. That's a choice. Interesting.] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Neat, huh? And don't worry. They'll be mice again at midnight. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Opalescence, no! 
["mouse-horses" neighing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala? 
<b>Rarity</b>: Whatever shall we do? 
<b>Rarity</b>: Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala? <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh. Yeah. Right. <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! 
<b>Spike</b>: Come on, you guys. Let me in! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sure thing, Spike. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Heavens no! We're getting dressed. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes. 
<b>Rarity</b>: [moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards. 
<b>Spike</b>: I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our hometown, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh... I-I don't know, Spike. 
<b>Rarity</b>: We'll just have to see. 
<b>Applejack</b>: We're gonna be a mite busy. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Busy having fun! [boing] 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh. Okay. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together. 
<b>Spike</b>: Great! <b>Spike</b>: 'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop. 
[excited chatter inside carriage] 
<b>Spike</b>: Then let's get moving! Hyah! 
<b>Caramel</b>: Excuse me!? 
<b>Spike</b>: Um... I... 
<b>Lucky Clover</b>: If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph. <b>Spike</b>: Whoa! You all look... amazing! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe we're finally here.

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It is? 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.
