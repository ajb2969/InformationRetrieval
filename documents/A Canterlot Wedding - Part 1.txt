<b>Rarity</b>: Ahh! 
[running footsteps] 
<b>Rarity</b>: It is  <i>gorgeous</i> out. Just gorgeous! 
[running footsteps] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [slurp] 
[running footsteps] 
<b>Spike</b>: Twi... light! ...I... have... Lemme just... [deep breath] [belch] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.</i> [to the others] Wedding? [reading]  <i>I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh my goodness! What an honor! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.</i> 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hip, hip, hooray! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.</i> 
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, color me pleased as punch! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Rainbow Dash–</i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawn] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their "I do"'s.</i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:  <i>Yes</i>! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.</i> 
<b>Rarity</b>: Princess Celestia wants me to– [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh! 
[thump] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia.</i> But... I don't understand. Who's getting married? 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...</i> [gasp] My brother?! <b>Applejack</b>: Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah,  <i>great</i> news. That I just got from a  <i>wedding invitation</i>! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [as  <b>Shining Armor</b>] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, never mind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation. [normal] Princess  <i>Mi Amore Cadenza</i>? Who in the hoof is that?! [snort] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Twilight? Are you okay? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F! [beat] Big Brother Best Friend Forever? 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: Ohhh! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend. <dl>  <dd>   When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly   </dd>  <dd>   To see how many other ponies I could meet   </dd>  <dd>   I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need   </dd>  <dd>   Other ponies to make my life complete   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   But there was one colt that I cared for   </dd>  <dd>   I knew he would be there for me   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   My big brother, best friend forever!   </dd>  <dd>   Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together   </dd> </dl> <dl>  <dd>   He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!)   </dd>  <dd>   We never had a single fight (We did everything together!)   </dd>  <dd>   We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams   </dd>  <dd>   I miss him more than I realized   </dd>  <dd>   It seems...   </dd> </dl> <b>[Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   Your big brother, best friend forever   </dd>  <dd>   Like two peas in a pod, you did everything together   </dd> </dl> <b>[Twilight Sparkle]</b>  <dl>  <dd>   And though he's, oh, so far away   </dd>  <dd>   I hoped that he would stay   </dd>  <dd>   My big brother best friend   </dd>  <dd>   Forever...   </dd>  <dd>   Forever...   </dd> </dl> 
<b>Applejack</b>: As one of your P.F.F.'s... [beat] Pony Friends Forever... 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: Ohhh! 
<b>Applejack</b>: ...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard. 
<b>Rarity</b>: [chirp] So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a  <i>captain of the Royal Guard?</i> 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I guess we are. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, ooh, oooh! 
[thump] 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [excited chattering] <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A sonic rainboom? At a  <i>wedding</i>?! Can you say "best wedding  <i>ever</i>"?! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasp] [echoing]  <i>Best wedding ever</i>! 
<b>Spike</b>: So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but  <i>I'm</i> the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>,  <b> Rarity</b>,  <b> Pinkie Pie</b>,  <b> Applejack</b>, and  <b> Fluttershy</b>: [laughter] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Why the long face, sugarcube? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername", we'll probably  <i>never</i> see each other. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married. <b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We're here, we're here! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa, what's with all the guards? 
<b>Rarity</b>: I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aaaaaaaaa– [sneezes like a trumpet] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Now, let's get going! We've got work to do! 
<b>Applejack</b>: And  <i>you've</i> got a big brother to go congratulate. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah.  <i>Congratulate</i>. And then give him a piece of my mind. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got something to say to you, mister. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I– 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How  <i>dare</i> you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see. 
[pop] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You want  <i>me</i> to be your best mare? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Well... yeah. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance? As in  <i>the</i> Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [chuckles] You tell me. She was  <i>your</i> foalsitter. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind... <b>Young Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter! 
<b>Young Cadance</b>: I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight. 
<b>Young Twilight Sparkle</b>: [scoffs] You're a  <i>princess</i>. I'm just a regular old unicorn. 
<b>Young Cadance</b>: You are  <i>anything</i> but a regular old unicorn. 
<b>Young Twilight</b> and  <b>Young Cadance</b>: Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [laughing] <b>Wild Fire</b>: I am going for a hooficure and that is that! 
<b>Lucky Clover</b>: You are not going– 
<b>Wild Fire</b>: I am! I am! 
<b>Lucky Clover</b>: I've already paid for three this month! 
<b>Wild Fire</b>: I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl– 
<b>Lucky Clover</b>: Please, we've done this at least– 
<b>Lucky Clover</b> and  <b>Wild Fire</b>: [suddenly stop arguing] 
<b>Lucky Clover</b>: Oh! Ho, ho, ho. 
<b>Wild Fire</b>: Oh, sweetie. You just did that face. <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And  <i>you're</i> marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: I hope I'm not interrupting anything important. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: What are you doing? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Cadance, it's me, Twilight! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [uninterested] Uh-huh. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear? 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Absolutely. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Well, we'll let you get to it. [country music] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted... 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mmm. Check. 
<b>Spike</b>: [deep voice] I do. Do you? [high voice] I do! [kissing noises] [laughs nervously] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hiya, Princess! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day? 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: I have! 
[sinister chords] 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [gulp] Delicious! I love-love-love them. [laughs nervously] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go? [squee] I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly. 
[thud] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] 
[door closes] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Did... you see what she... <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza." 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Did I hear someone say my name? 
<b>Rarity</b>: Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [laughs nervously] 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready? 
<b>Rarity</b>: [stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, yes, of course. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: And those should be a different color. 
<b>Twinkleshine</b>: I think they're lovely. 
<b>Minuette</b>: Me too! 
<b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: I love them. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Make them a different color. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants." [pop] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances... 
[polka from Swarm of the Century plays and stops] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you? 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Thank you! <b>Princess Luna</b>: Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever. 
<b>Spike</b>: [high voice] Who, me? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Spike! That goes on the cake. 
<b>Spike</b>: [laughs nervously] 
<b>Rarity</b>: Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, she was so demanding! 
<b>Rarity</b>: Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, she was just being fake and totally insincere! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: See? Rude! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: But he  <i>was</i> singing really off-key. 
[bird sings off-key] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated– 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and  <b>Spike</b>: [kissing noises and laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [growls] 
<b>Rarity</b>: The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves. 
[thump] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And  <i>I'm</i> sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother? 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: Uh-huh. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I am  <i>not</i> being possessive, and I am  <i>not</i> taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even [thumps table]  <i>be</i> a wedding! [knocking] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We need to talk. I think you're making a big– 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [clears throat] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Oh, uh, hi, sweetie. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She sure has a way of sneaking up on people. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Could I speak to you for a moment, dear? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Better see what she wants. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] Look, we need to talk. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I'm here to talk. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] It's about your sister, okay? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I– look, look, she's okay– 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no– 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: This was my favorite uncle's. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: And? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: And I think I should wear it. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Are you disagreeing with me? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: I guess I am– Ah! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Gyah! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Feeling better? 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: [grunts] Mm-hmm. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Twilight! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Let her go. 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me. <b>Princess Luna</b>: Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help– 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [various chatter] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Dresses? What are you–? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>:  <i>New</i> bridesmaids? What happened to her  <i>old</i> bridesmaids? 
<b>Applejack</b>: She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love- <i>love</i> it if we'd fill in for them. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything. 
<b>Applejack</b>: And you had your doubts about her. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Told you she was an absolute gem! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Hmm. I'll see what I can do. 
<b>Applejack</b>,  <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, and  <b>Fluttershy</b>: [excited chatter and laughing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Looks like I really am on my own. [church organ music] 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter. 
[Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays] 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare. 
<b>Spike</b>: [deep voice] Do you? [high voice] I do! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: Hey... has anypony seen Twilight? 
[doors open] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm here! I'm  <i>not</i> gonna stand next to her! And neither should you! 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this. 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: Maybe we should just ignore her. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You have to listen to me! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, goodness! Are you okay? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm fine. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Ya sure about that? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've got something to say! She's  <i>evil</i>! 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [concerned chattering] 
<b>Royal guard</b>: [inaudible comment to other guard] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [starts crying] Why are you doing this to me?! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Because you're evil! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: [crying] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life! 
[smack] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to  <i>heal</i> me! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [inhales] 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be  <i>in</i> the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your [stomps hoof] friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was just trying to– 
<b>Shining Armor</b>: She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to  <i>you</i>! [gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all. 
<b>Applejack</b>: C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I was– 
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: You have a lot to think about. 
[doors slam] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother. <dl>  <dd>   He was my big brother, best friend   </dd>  <dd>   Forever...   </dd>  <dd>   And now, we'll never do anything   </dd>  <dd>   Together...   </dd> </dl> 
[smashing noise] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sorry! 
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: You  <i>will</i> be.
