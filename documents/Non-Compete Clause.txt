[whooshing]
[papers fluttering]
<b>Yona</b>: Huh?
[whooshing]
<b>Silverstream</b>: Whoa!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
<b>Applejack</b>: You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, right. I got this one nailed.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
<b>Applejack</b>: [groans] Again?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.
[camera flashes]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. Me, neither.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
[beat]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Congratulations, Fluttershy!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [giggles]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
[pages flapping]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two
 states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section 
two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. 
Add that together, and what do you get?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
<b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
<b>Applejack</b>: [stutters]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [stutters]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Both of you are teamwork experts. If 
the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even 
more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd 
never let that get in the way of friendship education.
<b>Applejack</b>: Of course!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Totally!
<b>Applejack</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans, chuckles]
[theme song]
<b>Ocellus</b>: I've never been on a field trip before.
<b>Smolder</b>: Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?
<b>Gallus</b>: Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
<b>Yona</b>: Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts]
<b>Silverstream</b>: That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]
<b>Sandbar</b>: [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.
<b>Applejack</b>: Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!
<b>Applejack</b>: [chuckles nervously] With <i>us</i> in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. Good one.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
<b>Applejack</b>:
Shed buildin'!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:
Canoe racing!
<b>Silverstream</b>: No... way. We get to do both?!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
<b>Applejack</b>: Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!
<b>Applejack</b>: [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?
<b>Gallus</b>: [inhale] Uh, yak?
<b>Yona</b>: [sniffing] Mm-hmm!
<b>Applejack</b>: Nope. Try again.
<b>Ocellus</b>: Um, apples?
<b>Applejack</b>: And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of...
 teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna
 use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard 
work and honest sweat.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
<b>Applejack</b>: Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to <i>my</i> activity.
[montage music]
[hammering]
[sawing]
<b>Applejack</b>: That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Emphasis on the slow.
[whoosh]
[thudding]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunting]
<b>Applejack</b>: Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!
[thud]
<b>Sandbar</b>: Whoa! No way!
<b>Rest of Young Six</b>: Whoa!
<b>Gallus</b>: Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
<b>Applejack</b>: Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose. [grunting]
<b>Applejack</b>: Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, come on! These students are <i>totally</i> gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!
<b>Applejack</b>: No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done <i>right</i>!
<b>Smolder</b>: Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...
[montage music continues]
[wood creaking]
[hammering]
<b>Applejack</b>: Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
[creaking]
<b>Applejack</b>: Little to the left...
[creaking]
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh, a hair to the right...
[creaking]
<b>Applejack</b>: Now, a hoof shavin' higher...
[creaking]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [growls] <i>Just bring it down already!</i>
<b>Gallus</b> and <b>Smolder</b>: [yelps]
<b>Applejack</b>: [yelps]
[crash]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles nervously]
<b>Applejack</b>: I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
<b>Yona</b>: Yak side! [grunts]
[thud]
<b>Yona</b>: [chuckles nervously] Uh...
<b>Applejack</b>: [sighs]
<b>Ocellus</b>: Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
<b>Applejack</b>: [growls]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
[cricket chirping]
<b>Gallus</b>: Is that even a thing?
<b>Sandbar</b>: First I've heard of it.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
<b>Yona</b>: Uh, Yona has questions.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
<b>Applejack</b>: You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
[splashing]
<b>Yona</b>: Yak not like water.
<b>Ocellus</b>: Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle.
<b>Yona</b>: [weak whistling]
<b>Gallus</b>: We got you, Yona.
<b>Yona</b>: [yelping]
[thud]
<b>Applejack</b>: Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We'll see about that.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!
<b>Applejack</b>: Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.
<b>Silverstream</b>: Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
<b>Smolder</b>: So... when do we get to the part when we move?
[water splashing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: When everycreature starts listening to <i>me</i>, the leader of <i>my</i> activity, <i>Applejack</i>! Now stroke!
[water splashing]
[water rushing]
[watch ticking]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!
<b>Applejack</b>: Stop!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Go!
<b>Ocellus</b>: Which way do we go?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Left!
<b>Applejack</b>: Right!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Left! I can see the finish line from here!
<b>Applejack</b>: If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who cares about a few fish?
<b>Sandbar</b>: Uh, professors?
<b>Applejack</b>: You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
<b>Sandbar</b>: Guys?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We'll just go around them!
<b>Sandbar</b>: <i>Rock!</i>
<b>All</b>: [screaming]
[crash!]
[water rushing]
<b>All</b>: [gasping, coughing]
<b>Silverstream</b>: [giggling]
<b>Yona</b>: [panicked whistling] Oof! [grunting]
[rip!]
<b>Silverstream</b>: I love field trips!
<b>Applejack</b>: I hope you're happy.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
<b>Yona</b>: [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!
[transformation zap]
<b>Ocellus</b>: That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
<b>Yona</b>: [panicked whistling, coughing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: How's the canoeing... going?
<b>Smolder</b>: About as good as the apple shed building.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
<b>Applejack</b>: I did not!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Did too!
<b>Applejack</b>: Did not!
<b>Gallus</b>: Yup. It's been like this all day.
<b>Sandbar</b>: I wouldn't say <i>all</i> day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We are! Mostly.
<b>Applejack</b>: We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care
 about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be 
thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field 
trip!
<b>Applejack</b>: H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash
 for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to 
build a shed.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way! <i>You're</i> the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
[beat]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.
<b>Applejack</b>: Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Field trip?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well...
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?
<b>Applejack</b>: Right as rain and twice as fresh!
[hoof-bump]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Fine. But <i>I'm</i> picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
<b>Applejack</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Right!
<b>Applejack</b>: See? We're agreein' already.
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?
<b>Smolder</b>: Ugh. Here we go again.
<b>Applejack</b>: Where to, Rainbow Dash?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes <i>you</i> happy makes <i>me</i> happy.
<b>Applejack</b>: Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to <i>you</i>.
<b>Yona</b>: Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
<b>Applejack</b>: Hey! Where are y'all goin'?
[montage music]
<b>Ocellus</b>: I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
<b>Sandbar</b>: Only because <i>someponies</i> won't make up their minds about which way to go.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
<b>Applejack</b>: Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] No, no. <i>I</i> insist.
<b>Applejack</b>: Heh. But <i>I</i> insisted first.
<b>Silverstream</b>: Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
<b>Smolder</b>: Ugh.
[whoosh]
<b>Smolder</b>: We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a 
bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, 
if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Only if <i>you</i> want to build a bridge.
<b>Gallus</b>: <i>Stop!</i> Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
<b>Applejack</b>: Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Cooperation!
<b>Applejack</b>: Togetherness!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You are so right!
<b>Applejack</b>: Only as right as you are!
<b>Smolder</b>: <i>Okay!</i> We'll build a bridge! What do we use?
<b>Applejack</b>:
Branches!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:
Vines!
[beat]
<b>Applejack</b>:
Vines!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:
Branches!
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story!
[montage music]
<b>Ocellus</b>: [yawns]
[crickets chirping]
<b>Applejack</b>: [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
<b>Young Six</b>: [gasps]
<b>Applejack</b>: [grunting]
<b>Young Six</b>: [sighs]
[crack]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping] ...easy to work with.
<b>Young Six</b>: [gasps]
[wind whistling]
<b>Applejack</b>: [muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams]
<b>Applejack</b>: [screams]
<b>Applejack</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming] Help!
<b>Ocellus</b>: Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something.
[vines creaking]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunting] I can't get out!
<b>Applejack</b>: Let me try. [grunting]
[vines creaking]
[teeth snapping]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
[splashing]
<b>Applejack</b>: Mm-hmm.
[teeth snapping]
<b>Applejack</b>: And they look mighty hungry.
<b>Sandbar</b>: We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
<b>Gallus</b>: Leave 'em hangin'?
<b>Silverstream</b>: What?!
<b>Gallus</b>: I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
<b>Ocellus</b>: We need to work fast! And together!
[vines snapping]
<b>Smolder</b>: But mainly fast.
<b>Applejack</b>: I hate to admit it, but—
[vines snapping]
<b>Applejack</b>: ...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
<b>Applejack</b>: So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I thought you'd never ask.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Applejack</b>: [screams]
<b>Ocellus</b>: Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ocellus?!
<b>Applejack</b>: [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
[splashing]
<b>Ocellus</b>: [roars, chomp-chomp]
[splashing]
[vines snapping]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Applejack</b>: [screaming]
<b>Silverstream</b>: Need a lift?
<b>Yona</b>: Yak smash! [grunting]
<b>Sandbar</b>: [grunting]
<b>Smolder</b>: [grunting]
<b>Yona</b>: [laughing, grunting]
<b>Sandbar</b>: Welcome back, professors!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Now, <i>that</i> was a rescue!
<b>Applejack</b>: And y'all did it together!
<b>Young Six</b>: [cheering]
<b>Gallus</b>: No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
<b>Ocellus</b>: [growls]
<b>Gallus</b>: [screams]
<b>Ocellus</b>: [chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
<b>Silverstream</b>: [giggles] Best... field trip... ever!
[door opens]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b> and <b>Applejack</b>: Uhhhh...
<b>Yona</b>: Yak learn ponies smart!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
<b>Gallus</b>: It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what <i>not</i> to do so we'd figure out what we <i>should</i> do.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Really...?
<b>Sandbar</b>: It took us a while to get it.
<b>Smolder</b>: Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
<b>Silverstream</b>: But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.
<b>Gallus</b>: Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
<b>Ocellus</b>: We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad 
to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule 
another one right away.
<b>Young Six</b>: [cheering]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?
<b>Applejack</b>: To tell you the truth... yeah.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, not <i>all</i> the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
<b>Applejack</b>: Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [groans]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You were the one doing the "angling"!
<b>Applejack</b>: [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>:
What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!
<b>Applejack</b>:
Look, we all live in the same town here...!
