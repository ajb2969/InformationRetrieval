Common Ground
Season 9
<b>Announcer</b>: Highlights in the world of sports! Buckball 
fever has swept Equestria! What started as a backyard hobby for fruit 
farmers and the like has blossomed into a literal phenomenon, with 
something for everypony. Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies alike can't 
get enough of this breakthrough sport.
[fans cheering]
<b>Announcer</b>: And with its popularity still on the rise, buckball fans want—nay, <i>demand</i>—an
 institution catering to their new obsession. And the ponies of 
Appleloosa answered the call, delivering a state-of-the-art locale where
 fans Equestria over can celebrate their passion: the Buckball Hall of 
Fame. Though given the game's recent nature, the only inductees so far 
will be the members of the current championship team from Ponyville.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering loudly] Do you think they know we're here?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think they have a pretty good idea.
<b>Snails</b>: A pretty good idea about what? [chomps]
[theme song]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't believe the ponies of Appleloosa built this place.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, especially after their team lost to us. They must <i>really</i> love buckball.
<b>Fan</b>: [chuckles] Oh, my gosh! It's you! I can't believe you're you! I mean, here! I mean, Team Ponyville! Yeah!
<b>Snails</b>: Yep, it's us.
<b>Fan</b>: How much for an autograph?
<b>Snips</b>: Bits for autographs, eh?
[cha-ching!]
<b>Snips</b>: [whispering] Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
<b>Snails</b>: What is the sound of one hoof clapping?
<b>Snips</b>: Yeah! I mean, uh, no! How many of you would pay for an autograph from my best friend Snails?
[ponies clamoring]
<b>Male Pony</b>: I can't believe I'm about to get his autograph.
<b>Snails</b>: Wow! That's a lot of writing.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'm so proud they decided to honor us. I never thought I'd get to be in anything like a Hall of Fame.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Me, neither! Unless you count a Royal Order 
of Party Planners Memorial Library, which I don't, because every party 
planner gets one of those eventually.
[hooves clack]
[clamoring continues]
[bits jingling]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I hope Snails finishes signing autographs 
soon. We can't play without him. And if we lose or forfeit one game, 
we'll be out of the tournament.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, he better get his flank over here then! You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, why?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to <i>all</i>
 the museum exhibits and tell her about them. I'm gonna try to get in 
first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! Then you'd better hurry. Looks like there's already a line.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What?! [grunts] The doors aren't even open yet! What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: The real question is what kind of sports fan <i>doesn't</i>?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [gasps] Quibble Pants?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Rainbow Dash, fancy meeting <i>you</i> here.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fancy meeting <i>me</i>? I'm a sportspony. Of course <i>I'd</i> be here. What's fancy is <i>you</i> being here. If "fancy" meant confusing.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: There's nothing fancy <i>or</i> confusing about it. Y-You can't keep me away from that... that buckball rink. I'm... I'm the biggest fan there is.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, it's a buckball <i>field</i>. And you <i>are</i>?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh... sure. What w-with all th-the <i>bucking</i> and the <i>balling</i>,
 uh, uh, on the buckball field, w-which is where they play buckball. 
I-I-I wanted to be first inside to experience the grand history of the 
sport. I-I mean, I guess only a real fan would understand that.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whaaaa...?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh, perfect timing. Rainbow Dash, I'd like you to meet Clear Sky, the most amazing pony I've ever met.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration. [to Clear Sky] No offense.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: None taken. When it comes to describing your 
special somepony, a little exaggeration's normal. [to Quibble] And I 
feel the same way about you.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And who is this?
<b>Clear Sky</b>: This is my daughter Wind Sprint.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: And she is pretty amazing, too!
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Wind, did you thank Quibble for camping out so we'd be first in line?
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: [unenthusiastic] Thanks.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: No problem. I-I-I probably would have 
done it anyway. I mean, I... I can't wait to see the... [reading from a 
brochure] "evolution of the buck basket from farm to field"! That... 
That sounds just, I mean, oh, wow! There... There is a lot to see!
[crowd cheering]
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: I'd rather see the game.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh. Well, I... I mean, sure. T-T-That makes sense. We could just go to the tournament instead.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: No! Quibble planned this whole thing for us, and you could be a little more appreciative!
[door opens]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chuckles] I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too. <i>But</i> I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Ugh! <i>All</i> of them?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: You, know, I-I'd like a chance to catch 
up with Rainbow Dash. Why don't we split up? We'll... We'll cover more 
ground that way, and...
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>So</i>... you and Clear Sky, huh?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh, yeah, she's great. Honestly, I've 
never been happier... [panicked] Which is why I need your help! I don't 
know what any of this stuff is!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What do you mean?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: See this? I-I don't know what it is.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A ball?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: W— And this? I-I— No idea!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's a basket. How do you not know what these are?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I'm not even a hundred percent sure what <i>bucking</i> is. I literally know nothing about buckball or any other sport!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: But Wind Sprint <i>is</i>, and her dad 
was some big athlete, too. I-I can't compete with that. I really want 
things with Clear Sky to work out, but if Wind doesn't like me, I-I 
might as well give up.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, why?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: They're a family. Even if it's okay with 
Clear Sky, I wouldn't ask them to make me a part of it if Wind Sprint 
isn't on board. I thought if I could convince Wind I was a big buckball 
fan, we'd have something to bond over, but I'm... I'm pretty sure she's 
on to me.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [grunting]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Give it a shot. It's easy.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Aah! Aah! Oof!
[thud]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Could... Could <i>you</i> talk to her? I-I mean, you're a famous sportspony. Y-You'd know what to say. Maybe you could talk me up a little.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ha! No problem. I've totally got your flank.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [grunts]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [to Wind Sprint] Trust me, the game's a <i>lot</i> harder to play with apples.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: You play?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Who do you think taught them? Of course, 
being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice 
as much as I'd like.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Wait. You're Rainbow Dash? The Wonderbolt? Whoa, my dad was a great flyer, too.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hmm, you don't say. You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: [groans]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [grunts]
[thud]
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: [unconvinced] If you say so.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think I've seen enough of this museum for <i>three</i> Applejacks. Let's go watch some buckball!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: That sounds awesome! Oh, but first, I got you [singsongy] a little surprise.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: [unimpressed] Oh. A book.
[thud]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh, not just a book. It's a buckball almanac. This thing has every buckball fact and statistic ever recorded!
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: [sarcastic] Wow.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I know! I never realized there was so much math in buckball. I-I mean, this game's got more numbers than <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>. [laughs, snorts]
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Thanks?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I-I-I guess I could hold it for you. You know, so you don't have to carry it.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Can we go to the game now?
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Sure, honey. Listen, Q, this trip was a 
lovely idea, and the book was sweet, but you don't have to try so hard. 
Everything's gonna be fine. [kisses]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Not even my presents are in the ball court.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, do you mean "ball park"?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Do I?! I don't know! One thing's for sure: Wind is never gonna like a pony like me.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Of course she will. She just needs to see your sporty side.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I don't <i>have</i> a sporty side.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Every</i>pony has a sporty side, and 
we're gonna find yours. By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into 
the sportiest pony in Equestria!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Look, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but it's a terrible idea! You can't turn <i>me</i> into an athlete! It's impossible!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Ooh! Ah! [laughs]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Uh, I have a 17 charisma, all right? Don't you think I tried? She doesn't even like <i>Daring Do</i>. She thinks she's not athletic enough.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What?! Wow. We need to get started on "Operation: Sportify" ASAP.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are. Everypony's got something. Speed!
[zooming]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Strength!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Whoa!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Agility! Heh. Of course, some ponies can do it all.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: You're amazing, but what about me?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Right. We should probably start small. I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Okay. Uh-huh.
[music builds up]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: And... buckball!
[thud]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Ow.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay. Maybe agility's not your thing.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ready?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: If I say no, do I still have to run?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yep.
<b>Snips</b>: Can we get on with this? Snails and I did so well
 with the autographs, we decided to expand. And these souvenirs are not 
going to sell themselves!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Remember, think speed.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Got it.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: On your marks, get set...
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Speed. <i>Speed.</i>
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Go! [blows whistle]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Whew! [laughs] Okay! What a race, right? Oh. So much for speed.
<b>Snips</b>: Eh, this was fun, but I've gotta get back to work.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on, Quibble. You got this!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [strained voice] I... got... this! I... 
Ugh! This is hopeless. I... I don't have any skills. Not agility, not 
speed. I-I can't even lift more than one book, and I love books!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony. [groans] Or at least a <i>sportier</i> pony.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Who knows how long that would take? I-I need to get Wind to like me <i>now</i>.
[crowd cheering]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or... even a little bit strong.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I-I'm sorry, wait. Is this supposed to be making me feel better? Because it's not.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>But</i> none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you!
[action theme]
[whistle blows]
[crowd cheering]
<b>Game Announcer</b>: And with that score, the stars of Team 
Ponyville advance to the next round. If they keep winning like this, 
they'll never get off the field.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Wow! The players from Ponyville are so good!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: They sure are.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Quibble, where have you been? I was hoping we'd all watch the tournament together.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh, I've just been arranging for us to 
hang out with a few of my close friends. From Team Ponyville. That is, 
if Wind's up for it.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: This is wonderful, Q, but I still feel like you're trying too hard to get Wind's approval.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: This is so great! Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are the best players out there!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, you can thank Quibble. Wonderbolts, 
buckball stars... He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he 
must be pretty sporty, too, right?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, so <i>this</i> is Quibble Pants. 
Rainbow Dash told us all about how you two spent a whole Daring Do 
convention geeking out together about books!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: And even though at first she thought you were the most annoying fanpony she ever met, you two eventually became friends.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Uh...
<b>Clear Sky</b>: I guess even sportsponies agree. Quibble's a pony you like more and more over time.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Ugh. Knowing sportsponies isn't the same as
 being one. [to Fluttershy and Pinkie] What's it like playing in front 
of all those fans?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um...
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I guess you'll find out.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: What do you mean?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Yes, what <i>do</i> you mean?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Q, Wind really doesn't need any more surprises.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Is it another book?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: A – books are awesome. And B – this is way
 more awesomer than that! For the tournament halftime show, you and 
Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: We're <i>what?!</i>
[distant crowd cheering]
[whoosh, thud]
[whirring, thuds]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, you should probably stretch.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: No amount of stretching is gonna make this okay! What were you thinking?!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Really? How does me making a fool of myself in front of her, Sky, and a billion buckball fans make sense?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't worry, I've got your flank. I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. They're <i>totally</i> gonna make you look good.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh. Okay, well, maybe this isn't the absolute worst idea ever.
<b>Game Announcer</b>: Mares and stallions, foals and colts! 
Put your hooves together for today's halftime presentation, as 
buckball's biggest stars take on a team of fans just like you!
[crowd cheering]
<b>Referee</b>: [blows whistle]
[whoosh]
[thud]
[crowd cheers]
<b>Game Announcer</b>: And that's one for the Ponyville champs! Looks like these fans don't know what they signed up for!
<b>Referee</b>: [blows whistle]
[whooshing]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [flatly] Oh, no. Quibble's wide open, and I'll never get there in time to block.
[whoosh]
[slow motion noise]
[crowd awwws]
<b>Game Announcer</b>: Ooh! Looks like our fan team needs to work on their passing!
<b>Referee</b>: [blows whistle]
[whooshing]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hee-hee!
[crack]
[smack]
[thud]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps]
<b>Game Announcer</b>: And the fan team finally scores! ...For the other side. That makes three! Team Ponyville wins!
[smack]
[thud]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: It says very clearly on page 
six-forty-seven of the expanded buckball tournament rules that "a goal 
is scored when an Earth pony sends the ball into a basket". But it 
doesn't say <i>which</i> basket!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: But the rules don't say that! If that goal is ours, it's only two-to-one, and we can keep playing.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: I don't <i>want</i> to! You're <i>not</i> a sportspony! It's <i>not</i> fun playing this game with you!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I was just... trying to get her to like me.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: I know! But I told you you didn't need to. You and I have to rethink all of this.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [whimpers, sighs]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What are you doing out here?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Apparently this book is as close to sports as I'll ever get.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on. That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [sighs] Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash, but I think we can both agree the whole sportify idea was a big flop.
[thump]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What?! We haven't even gotten started! I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: [sighs] Wind's already made up her mind, and so have I. Time to throw up the towel.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's "throw <i>in</i> the towel". And that's ridiculous! You can't just give up!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Wind and Sky deserve a pony they both 
like in their lives. Besides, Sky wants to "rethink things", so I'm just
 beating her to the lunch.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's "beating her to the <i>punch</i>", and it's barely a sports reference. How do you not know that?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Because... I! Don't! Know! <i>Anything</i>! About! Sports! And pretending I did just made things worse.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So you should stop pretending! Look, you are <i>terrible</i> at sports. You're uncoordinated, slow, weak—
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Okay, again, not really making me feel better.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics. But maybe <i>I'm</i> not the pony you should've come to for help.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Oh.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: I wish we didn't even come here.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Quibble thought you'd like it.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Well, I don't, and I don't like him. Why do <i>you</i> like him?
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Because he's kind, and smart, and his friends certainly seem to care about him, which is always a good sign.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: I don't care how many ponies care about him. They're not gonna make me forget about Dad.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Oh, sweetheart. I know Quibble's trying too 
hard, but he doesn't want you to stop loving your dad. He just wants you
 to like him. And I think maybe there's enough room in your heart to do 
both.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Hey, there. Glad I found you, because I 
have a confession to make. I know it's hard to imagine, but I'm... 
really not all that sporty.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: [mock horror] [gasps] No!
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I'm sorry I was trying so hard to 
convince you otherwise. I just really wanted us to get along, but I 
guess it backfired. Do you think we could start over? Maybe we could 
watch some of the tournament together, and you could teach me some 
sports stuff?
[whoosh, thud]
[crowd cheering]
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Okay. That's their ball.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: I'll try to remember that if I ever 
decide to play buckball again. But I probably won't. Oh, look. Pinkie 
Pie's gonna flip and triple bounce the ball into the goal.
[springing]
[thud]
[crowd cheers]
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: How did you know that?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: It's right here. Pinkie flips and 
triple-bounce bucks over eighty percent of her shots from the northwest 
section of the field when the wind is blowing from the east.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Huh. I guess this book's kind of cool after all.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: [slurping]
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Look, Sky, I know you're thinking of 
calling it quits between us, and after today, I don't blame you. But 
Wind and I just made a connection!
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Calling it quits? What are you talking about?
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: You said you wanted to rethink things.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Yeah! Things like having your friend help you <i>pretend</i> to be a sportspony so Wind would like you.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>: Wha— I-I don't— I— Oh! I-I didn't... What?!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Say wha—? [nervous laugh] Wha...?! Hah! Nah!
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: Mom, look what Quibble showed me! [reading]
 "When Fluttershy flies higher than the other Pegasus, Pinkie scores 
ninety-two percent of the time," and it just happened!
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Wow! You better watch out, or you're gonna start to like books.
<b>Wind Sprint</b>: I guess that wouldn't be so bad.
<b>Clear Sky</b>: Huh. Looks like you didn't need sportiness, famous ponies, or lavish gifts to bond with Wind after all.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.
<b>Quibble Pants</b>, <b>Clear Sky</b>, and <b>Wind Sprint</b>: [laughing]
