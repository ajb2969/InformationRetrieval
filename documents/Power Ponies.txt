<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, you really need to go to sleep! 
<b>Spike</b>: Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about to— 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: "The Mane-iac"? 
<b>Spike</b>: The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers, but also caused her to go  <i>completely insane</i>! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb, so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her  <i>all</i> about it. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hum Drum? 
<b>Spike</b>: Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw. 
<b>Spike</b>: Okay, okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight.

<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Two more minutes. 
<b>Spike</b>: Yes! <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You got it! 
<b>Spike</b>: Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A little more to the left! No, the other left! [quickly] Awesome! That's perfect right where it is! On to the next painting! 
<b>Spike</b>: You sure you don't need any help? 
<b>Applejack</b>: Nah, that's okay. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [quickly] We have everything under control! 
<b>Spike</b>: Dash? 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm good! 
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] Isn't there  <i>anything</i> I can help you with, Twilight? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [quickly] Don't worry about it, Spike! It's all good! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain? 
<b>Spike</b>: Hum Drum  <i>never</i> stops the villain. He's just there for comic relief. [splash and clatter] [grunts] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that! 
<b>Spike</b>:  <i>I</i> could do it! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's okay, Spike. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pony power! Weehee!! 
<b>Spike</b>: [sigh] 
[bucket clatters] <b>Spike</b>: [to himself] Mane-iac breaks into the museum... Okay, here we go. ...Ugh, what a surprise! Hum Drum is in the way again while the Power Ponies do all the work! I guess I know what that feels like... [gasps] Wait. What? How can that be the end?! What's... that? "You can... retr-" What? "You can... return..." Urgh! I  <i>know</i> I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here... 
<b>Applejack</b>: Spike! Where are ya, Spike? 
<b>Rarity</b>: We're breaking for tea and biscuits! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Spike! 
<b>Spike</b>: [reading] "You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is... defeated." Huh? "Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book"? What does that even mean? Whoa! Cool! 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike! What are you— 
<b>Spike</b>:  <i>Heeeeeelp!</i>

<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: My comic book! It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac! Your  <i>arch-nemesis</i>!

<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it! 
<span title="as Zapp" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers! 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Almost all of us have superpowers... 
<span title="as Radiance" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rarity</b></span>: But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape! 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless... 
<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then. 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Yeah, good thing... 
<span title="as Zapp" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville! 
<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device? 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up! 
<span title="as Mistress Mare-velous" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Applejack</b></span>: Lead the way, Spike! 
<span title="as Zapp" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Then leave the rest to us!

<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and— 
<span title="as Zapp" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in! 
[thunder crash] 
<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: So much for "element of surprise". 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing. 
[electricity crackling] 
<span title="as Saddle Rager" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Fluttershy</b></span>: Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later.

<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home! 
<b>Mane-iac</b>: I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time! 
<span title="as Zapp" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Rainbow Dash</b></span>: Just watch us! 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!

<b>Mane-iac</b>: [cackles] Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on  <i>you</i>? Rather pointless, don't you think?

<span title="as Masked Matter-Horn" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Twilight Sparkle</b></span>: Maybe in  <i>your</i> world. But in  <i>our</i> world, Spike— uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him!  <i>Always</i>! 
<b>Rest of Power Ponies</b>: [agreements] 
<span title="as Hum Drum" style="cursor:help; border-bottom:1px dotted"><b>Spike</b></span>: I'm  <i>not</i> like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I  <i>do</i> come through! And they need me now! 
<b>Mane-iac</b>: [laughs] I see dementia must be a side-effect of prolonged exposure to the Hairspray Ray of Doom. [laughs] Tonight, we stand upon the brink of immortality, for we collectively – though, mostly me – have finally defeated our most hated nemeses! We have hurled the brush of badness into the now fearful face of [laughs] goodness, and have struck a blow for freedom in the name of oppression! And  <i>nothing will stop us</i>! [laughs]
