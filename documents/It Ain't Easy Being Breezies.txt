<b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer! 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I 
 <i>love</i> cheers! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: But these cheers should be 
 <i>quiet</i> cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies. 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [shouting] You can do it, Breezies! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again. 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [quieter but still loudly] You can do it, Breezies! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Perhaps just a little bit quieter. 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [quieter] You can do it, Breezies! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Just a little quieter. 
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [practically whispering] You can do it, Breezies! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay. 
[mariachi music playing] 
[wind blowing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart! 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely. 
<b>Mrs. Cake</b>: We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Now you understand. 
<b>Mr. Cake</b>: Hm, you certainly know a lot about them. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but... 
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I 
 <i>knew</i> it! But Twilight refused to admit it. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What?! I- 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an 
 <i>awful</i> lot of sequins on your jacket. 
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins! [chuckles] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home! 
<b>Rarity</b>: I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either? 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies! 
<b>Applejack</b>: They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born. 
<b>Rarity</b>: And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in? 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Lun! Arshen aifok!</i> 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So... cute! Can't... take... it! 
<b>Spike</b>: [grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [hushed, straining] May explode! 
[thunk] 
[wind blows] 
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, no! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [panicking] 
<b>Crowd</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up! 
<b>Cloud Chaser</b>: They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What if we speed it up? 
<b>Flitter</b>: Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [panicking] 
<b>Breezies</b>: [panicking] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa!</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Mekenar stuf!</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can! 
<b>Crowd</b>: [cheering] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Mugudi saikendus?</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: You must be so proud. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: And you speak 
 <i>my</i> language too? 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>I</i> can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around. 
<b>Breezies</b>: [shouts of indignation] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That was 
 <i>amazing</i>! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, it's not your fault. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that. 
<b>Rarity</b>: I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash. 
<b>Spike</b>: Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us. 
<b>Spike</b>: Okay... Thank you! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [shouting] 
<b>Spike</b>: Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on? 
<b>Breezies</b>: [cries of protest] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much... 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Just gimme the word when you think they're ready. 
<b>Angel</b>: [whimpers] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket. 
<b>Twirly</b>: 
 <i>Sanken</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, no problem. 
<b>Breezie</b>: 
 <i>Malenki?</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, did you need some more water? 
<b>Breezie</b>: [slurps] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater? 
<b>Breezies</b>: [cheering] 
<b>Applejack</b>: Hey there! Can we come in? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, of course! But watch your step! 
<b>Applejack</b>: Oop, sorry about that, little one. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes, that's right! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [cries of protest] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready. 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat!</i> 
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh... what did he say? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'd... rather not say. 
<b>Applejack</b>: Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We'll just wait for your word. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon. 
[door closes] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: We need to go now, or we will never get home! I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, now, Seabreeze- 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I? 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: Hmph! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood. 
<b>Breezies</b>: [coos of interest] 
<b>Breezies</b>: [chewing] 
<b>Breezie</b>: [burp] 
 <i>Mi fargen.</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that- 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: There is nothing special about these losers! They cannot handle a simple breeze home! If they could just stick with the program and listen to me, we would be safe! At home! Home, where every Breezie is like us! [sighs] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible! 
<b>Breezie</b>: [sneezes] 
 <i>Merte marshken farde.</i> 
<b>Twirly</b>: [coughs] 
 <i>Merki marshken plumatu.</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you? 
<b>Breezies</b>: [coughing] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now? 
<b>Breezies</b>: [excited chattering] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen!</i> 
[knocking] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes? 
[door closes] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, alright. 
<b>Flitter</b>: We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing. 
<b>Breezies</b>: [excited chattering] 
[saxophone playing] 
[crash] 
<b>Breezies</b>: Aww! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home. 
<b>Breezies</b>: [dismayed shouts] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be... 
<b>Twirly</b>: 
 <i>Adoshen papan gorn.</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own! 
[wind blows] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah!</i> 
[series of thumps] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda!</i> 
[squeak] 
[bees buzzing] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Vaior uskren! Yavaya...</i> 
[bees buzzing] 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada!</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is 
 <i>not</i> working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away 
 <i>now</i>, or you'll have to answer to 
 <i>me</i>! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: 
 <i>Menkyulen.</i> Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it home! 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across. 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Yes, but they 
 <i>had</i> to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you 
 <i>must</i> leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville. 
<b>Breezies</b>: 
 <i>Erski parli polin!</i> 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm! You must go, now! [sniffs] [crying] 
[door closes] 
[wind blowing] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's too strong! 
<b>Flitter</b>: I can't do it any lighter! 
<b>Cloud Chaser</b>: Neither can I! 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me. 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I 
 <i>love</i> new ideas that make me feel funny at first! 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [giggles] 
<b>Main cast</b>: [excited noises] 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: 
 <i>Maifo flai batendud!</i> [high-pitched] Um, I mean, let's go! 
[wind blowing] 
<b>Breezette</b>: 
 <i>Marskin farskin.</i> 
<b>Breezie</b>: 
 <i>Metar.</i> 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: You can do this! I am sorry for how I treated you before! It was not right that I called you names! I did not even really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group! 
[wind blowing] 
<b>Main cast</b>: [gasps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise! 
<b>Rarity</b>: [high-pitched] This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it? 
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [high-pitched] So...stinkin'...cute! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [commotion] 
<b>Applejack</b>: [high-pitched] You okay, Fluttershy? 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family! 
<b>Breezies</b>: [commotion] 
<b>Rarity</b>: [high-pitched] We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now. 
<b>Seabreeze</b>: To remember us by. 
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] 
 <i>My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.</i> 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one! 
<b>Applejack</b> and 
 <b>Rarity</b>: [agreeing] 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [high-pitched] Okay, gather round. 
[magic zaps] 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon. 
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Not a chance. 
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire!
