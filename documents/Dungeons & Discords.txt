Dungeons & Discords
Season 6
<b>Discord</b>: Tea?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps]
<b>Discord</b>: Trendy coats? Bedrolls? Saddlebags? Oh! A 
surprise vacation just for the two of us? How thoughtful. I hear Puerto 
Caballo is lovely this time of year. Sand like powdered sugar. [blows]
[sprinkling]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out.
<b>Discord</b>:<b> </b>[gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac.
<b>Discord</b>: [laughs]
[beat]
<b>Discord</b>: You aren't kidding.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: They're very nice. They have a "top secret" 
thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows 
about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with 
them.
<b>Discord</b>: Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that 
we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] "Da-dee-la! 
I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm
 sure I'd have fun!"
<b>Opposite Fluttershy</b>: <i>Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!</i>
<b>Discord</b>: [snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I 
can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking 
about. You see?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: It never hurts to make new friends.
<b>Discord</b>: [scoffs] Consider it considered.
[magic poof]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [humming] [gasps]
<b>Discord</b>: Couldn't I just come with you instead?
[theme song]
<b>Discord</b>: I suppose this is goodbye then. Have an absolutely fabulous voyage. [snap]
[magic zap]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Discord...
<b>Discord</b>: [gasps] Well, it's not <i>my</i> fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.
[beat]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, you're no fun. [snap]
[magic zap]
<b>Applejack</b>: I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but 
functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our
 resident Yakyakistan expert.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nope! I brought yeti food!
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!
[train whistle blows]
[train chugging]
<b>Applejack</b>: Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?
<b>Spike</b>: I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. 
Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with 
you girls.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Buh-bye!
[train whistle blows]
<b>Applejack</b>: Bye, y'all!
[train chugging]
[train whistle]
[long beat]
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [unintelligible whispering]
<b>Spike</b>: [whispering] Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it...
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [hushed] Yup.
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, <i>please</i>
 don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, 
please, please— [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay 
and chat, but I don't want to.
<b>Spike</b>: Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?
<b>Discord</b>: [to himself] Oh, here we go...
<b>Spike</b>: Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.
<b>Spike</b>: [to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
<b>Discord</b>: A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?
<b>Spike</b>: Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two...
<b>Discord</b>: That does sound fun, actually...
<b>Spike</b>: Too bad you're busy.
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.
[click]
<b>Discord</b>: [gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. 
Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess
 Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole 
evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things
 up and bring a little class to the whole affair.
[magic zap]
[rumble]
<b>Discord</b>: [normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness.
<b>Spike</b>: I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
<b>Discord</b>: Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b>: And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b>: It's guys' night.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup.
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, yeah.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup.
<b>Spike</b>: Havin' fun now.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup.
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Oh, yeah!
[fanfare]
<b>Spike</b>: What the hay?
[cartoon skedaddling]
<b>Mini-Discord</b>: [high-pitched] Announcing the much 
anticipated arrival of the spirit of chaos and disharmony, the purveyor 
of pandemonium, lord of lawlessness, earl of turmoil, bringer of 
bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!
[electronic music playing]
[confetti exploding]
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.
<b>Spike</b>: Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!
<b>Discord</b>: Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?
[beat]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, come on!
<b>Spike</b>: Uh... I'm talkin' about a <i>real</i> game.
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.
[Celestia's mane yowls]
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b>: Not exactly. Wait here.
[beat]
<b>Discord</b>: Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix.
<b>Spike</b>: [off-screen] Okay!
[click]
<b>Spike</b>: In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>!
<b>Discord</b>: [gasps]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, this looks like...
<b>Spike</b>: The best game ever? You're right!
<b>Discord</b>: Yes...
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i> is a fantasy 
role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, 
or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [stifled laughter]
[beat]
<b>Spike</b>: [chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid
 siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land.
 He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, 
which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think 
about it too much.
<b>Discord</b>: Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
[zip!]
<b>Spike</b>: First things first – you've gotta create a character! Name?
<b>Discord</b>: How about... Discord?
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to
 use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous 
magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.
<b>Discord</b>: Just like in real life?
[crack]
<b>Spike</b>: And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.
[hairdryer running]
<b>Discord</b>: [not listening] Go on, I'm listening.
<b>Spike</b>: Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!
<b>Discord</b>: [still not listening] I'm listening.
<b>Spike</b>: When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nnope!
<b>Discord</b>: [clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
<b>Spike</b>: And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.
[balloon deflating]
<b>Spike</b>: So, your character's name?
<b>Discord</b>: I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"?
<b>Spike</b>: Captain Wuzz it is!
<b>Discord</b>: [groans]
<b>Spike</b>: What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...
<b>Discord</b>: [snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.
<b>Spike</b>: You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
<b>Discord</b>: Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
[tok]
<b>Spike</b>: Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>?
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
<b>Spike</b>: Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you—
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, get on with it.
<b>Spike</b>: [rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
[beat]
<b>Spike</b>: The bars exist in our <i>imagination</i>.
<b>Discord</b>: Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?
<b>Spike</b>: It is real. In our <i>imagination</i>. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
<b>Discord</b>: Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.
<b>Spike</b>: Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.
[clang]
<b>Discord</b>: I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
<b>Spike</b>: That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad.
<b>Discord</b>: This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
<b>Spike</b>: You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
<b>Discord</b>: I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
[thud]
<b>Spike</b>: [rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [chuckling] Parsnips. [laughs]
<b>Discord</b>: [growls]
<b>Spike</b>: The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
<b>Discord</b>: Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
<b>Spike</b>: [rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!
<b>Discord</b>: I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
<b>Spike</b>: I told you, you can't do magic!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [laughing]
[magic zap]
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
<b>Discord</b>: "Not intelligent enough." Please.
<b>Spike</b>: Cut it out, Discord!
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a <i>real</i> guys' night!
[snap]
[upbeat jazz]
<b>Discord</b>: [laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the
 best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I 
right, fellas?
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b>: I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!
<b>Discord</b>: I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] No, we want to go back to <i>Ogres &amp;</i>—
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are <i>very</i> bad cards.
<b>Spike</b>: Stop messing with us! We wanna—
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: A dance contest?
[upbeat jazz BGM]
<b>Discord</b>: Surprise! We won!
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Discord!</i>
<b>Discord</b>: [sinister] Yes?
<b>Spike</b>: Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna 
play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know,
 sit and watch.
<b>Discord</b>: Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of <i>Ogres &amp; Oubliettes</i>?
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b>: Sir McBiggun?!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b>: And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!
[magic zaps]
[shings]
<b>Spike</b>: It's guys' night!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup!
<b>Spike</b>: In the game now!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup!
<b>Spike</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Spike</b>: Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!
<b>Discord</b>: [reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
<b>Spike</b>: Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
[army marching]
<b>Squizard</b>: Behold! I am the Squizard!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [gasps]
<b>Discord</b>: [reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
<b>Squizard</b>: Attack!
[army shouting]
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Run!</i>
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [panting]
[arrows being fired]
<b>Discord</b>: [reverberating] <i>You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well...</i> [laughs] <i>You get the idea.</i>
[thud]
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Seventeen! Lucky you!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [grunts]
<b>Discord</b>: Boo.
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [panting]
<b>Discord</b>: Boo.
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [screaming]
<b>Spike</b>: <i>Discord!</i>
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you.
[shing!]
<b>Spike</b>: This isn't funny!
<b>Discord</b>: Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? <i>Like this?!</i>
[magic zaps]
[thud]
<b>Spike</b>: Ugh!
[army shouting]
[thud]
<b>Spike</b>: [groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?
<b>Spike</b>: Discord, this is awful!
[magic zap]
<b>Squizard</b>: Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride!
[beat]
<b>Squizard</b>: I mean, Shmarity.
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Big McIntosh</b>: [gibbering]
[thud]
<b>Spike</b>: Why are you doing this? You're the worst!
<b>Discord</b>: If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?
<b>Spike</b>: Because we felt bad for you!
<b>Discord</b>: Because you... <i>what?!</i>
[snap]
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b>: [panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to <i>you</i>, Discord!
<b>Discord</b>: <i>You</i> felt sorry for <i>me</i>?
<b>Spike</b>: Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically 
begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just 
standing there, all alone!
<b>Discord</b>: This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm <i>me</i> and you're <i>you</i>.
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
<b>Discord</b>: I ruined your night, and you don't even think 
I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I
 have a lot of <i>other</i> friends I need to see tonight.
<b>Spike</b>: Good!
<b>Discord</b>: Yes, <i>so</i> many other friends. [whimpers] 
Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence 
smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded 
Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half 
bad.
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh, well.
[magic zap]
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] It... it's better this way, right?
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup.
<b>Spike</b>: Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Yup.
<b>Spike</b>: [sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find 
ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, 
and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears 
throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?
[magic zap]
<b>Discord</b>: Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
[beat]
<b>Discord</b>: Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...
<b>Spike</b>: What?
<b>Discord</b>: I'm ssssssss—
<b>Spike</b>: Can't hear you.
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Nope.
<b>Discord</b>: I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm 
sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better 
than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any 
sappier, shall we?
[magic zap]
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: [unintelligible whispering]
<b>Spike</b>: Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the 
board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life
 was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, 
uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a 
teensy bit?
[main cast chattering]
[doors open]
<b>Mane Six</b>: Huh?
[army shouting]
<b>Spike</b>: I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!
[magic zap]
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Wha-hah!
<b>Discord</b>: [grunts]
<b>Spike</b>, <b>Big McIntosh</b> and <b>Discord</b>: [panting]
<b>Squizard</b>: [evil laughter]
<b>Discord</b>: [accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
[magic zap]
<b>Squizard</b>: [squeaks]
[crunch]
<b>Spike</b>: Bull's-eye!
<b>Discord</b>: Nice one!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Discord</b>: It's guys' night!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Discord</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Discord</b>: Having fun now!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Eeyup!
<b>Spike</b> and <b>Discord</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Big McIntosh</b>: Oh, yeah!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Guys' night!
