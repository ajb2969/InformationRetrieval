School Raze - Part 1
Season 8
[thud]
<b>Derpy</b>: [groans]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, 
Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your 
first class is just down that hall.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: A seven-letter word for "teamwork". Have you tried "synergy"?
<b>Silverstream</b>: That's it! Thanks, Cozy!
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: What are friends for?
[door opens, closes]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Good morning, Professor Sparkle!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The mail's here already? What time is it?! I'm late for my class's field trip to Cloudsdale! [panting]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And she said yes?
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how 
much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule
 by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the 
school. I hope that's okay.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: [giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: I heard they might do some sightseeing first.
[thunder and lightning]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
[sounds of awe]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!
<b>Ocellus</b>: Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi.
[wind whistling]
<b>Gallus</b>: Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared.
<b>Yona</b>: [teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!
[students gasp]
[theme song]
<b>Yona</b>: [screams]
[magic fizzles]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [gasps]
[ponies and creatures gasping]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Come on! We gotta catch 'em!
[ponies screaming]
<b>Yona</b>: [screams]
<b>Gallus</b>: Gotcha!
<b>Ocellus</b>: It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?
<b>Yona</b>: Flying, not falling!
[thud]
<b>Yona</b>: [kissing sounds]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.
[door opens]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: We have an emergency!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The students dropped out of the sky!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Slow down. What happened?
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: We barely caught everypony in time!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure
 it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong.
 Let's take a look.
[thud]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I didn't drop that book.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?
[thud]
<b>Rarity</b>: Ow!
[door opens]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Rarity ran into the door.
<b>Rarity</b>: [sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my <i>hooves</i> to coif my tail!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Still think there's nothing to worry about?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Tirek!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
[door opens]
<b>Spike</b>: [gagging]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Spike, what's wrong?
<b>Spike</b>: [gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a
 letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been 
called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!
[magic fizzles]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Pretty sure I know what it's about.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We experienced it first-hoof.
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues.
[door opens]
<b>"Special Delivery"</b>: [panting] Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
[ponies gasp]
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's what's happening now.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [gasps] Oh, no!
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: And finally, magical artifacts will 
stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world
 will be gone forever!
[ponies gasp]
<b>Princess Cadance</b>: But why is this happening now?
<b>Princess Luna</b>: That's the worst part. We have no idea.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Has anypony checked on Tirek?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa— Ohhhh. Riiiiight.
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We'll go.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo— Wait. Did you say "we"?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, duh!
<b>Princess Celestia</b>: Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Be careful. Tartarus has changed since 
you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be 
able to rely on your magic.
<b>Applejack</b>: With her friends by her side, she won't have to.
[door opens]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Got it!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: [sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?
<b>Spike</b>: Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Oh. I thought that after what happened last time—
<b>Spike</b>: Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: [whimpers]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Plus, she'll have you to help her.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best 
assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute 
headmare plans right now, if you like.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow. Uh, okay.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.
[doors open]
[students chattering]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Good morning, friendship students! I know 
we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she 
left me in charge to do things just the way she would.
<b>Gallus</b>: Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: She was, but she left me this note. [reading]
 "I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good 
hooves with you, Cozy." [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let 
Starlight down, will we?
[students agreeing]
<b>Smolder</b>: It's just kind of weird, isn't it?
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: I don't know what you mean.
<b>Smolder</b>: Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did 
Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't 
make any sense.
[students murmuring]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: [giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not 
scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a 
little extra friendship homework.
[students laughing]
<b>Smolder</b>: [growls]
<b>Yona</b>: Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework.
<b>Ocellus</b>: Me, too!
<b>Sandbar</b>: I'm in!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!
[beat]
<b>Gallus</b>: [groans] Fine.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be
 so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful 
because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I 
count on each of you to help me?
[students cheering]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!
[Fly-ders buzzing]
<b>Rarity</b>: [blows]
[smack!]
<b>Rarity</b>: Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?
<b>Rarity</b>: [gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: "Magic" this, "magic" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike.
[thunder]
[rain falling]
<b>Rarity</b>: You were saying?
<b>Applejack</b>: You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's "Apple Core No-Bite-No-More"! That'll keep the flies off.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat.
<b>Spike</b>: Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!
[thunder]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!
[students chattering]
<b>"Citrine Spark"</b>: Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!
<b>"Berry Bliss"</b>: And she made all of us friendship bracelets!
<b>"Patty Peppermint"</b>: She's the nicest pony I've ever met. I'm so glad she's headmare!
<b>Sandbar</b>: Uh, <i>temporary</i> headmare? Right, guys?
<b>"Citrine Spark"</b>: Oh, oh, of course. But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind.
[students laughing]
[door opens]
<b>Silverstream</b>: Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.
<b>Sandbar</b>: Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.
<b>Gallus</b>: You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?
<b>Ocellus</b>: Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
<b>Smolder</b>: I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?
[clattering]
<b>Yona</b>: And why Cozy pony coming out catacombs so late at night?
<b>Gallus</b>: Let's go ask her.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.
<b>Applejack</b>: Let me guess. You got bad news, too?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Last time I was here, I had to use 
magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone
 by yesterday's sunset.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe he was wrong.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts]
[magic fizzles]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't worry, Twilight. I got this.
[knock, knock]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Free pizza delivery!
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well.
<b>Applejack</b>: Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could <i>actually</i> help?
<b>Rarity</b>: These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid.
<b>Spike</b>: How about this?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?
<b>Spike</b>: In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: She really did think of everything.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, what does it do?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...
[whirring]
[gears clicking]
[cranking sounds]
[shatter!]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I guess it only works once.
[door slams]
[cockatrice hisses]
<b>Mane Six</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasp]
<b>Applejack</b>: Cockatrice!
<b>Rarity</b>: Do something, Fluttershy!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!
[cockatrice hisses]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't feel like stone.
[boing, boing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Unless it's really bouncy stone.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have.
[low growling]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.
<b>Spike</b>: I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!
[door opens]
[chair creaks]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Where is Princess Twilight?!
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her.
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Magic is failing across our land, and she left a <i>foal</i> in charge of this facility?
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, <i>I</i> am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!
[loud thudding]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Look out!
<b>Mane Six</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [scream]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: I'll talk to him.
<b>Cerberus</b>: [growls]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Um, excuse me, puppy?
<b>Cerberus</b>: [snorts]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek.
<b>Cerberus</b>: [slurping]
<b>Applejack</b>: That looks like a yes.
[splash!]
<b>Rarity</b>: I'll get you a towel, darling.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [giggling]
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria.
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: So you <i>are</i> behind this!
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it...
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: These aren't. Not anymore. With 
Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has 
endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these 
dangerous creatures run loose.
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: You don't think <i>they're</i> the reason magic is disappearing, do you?
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters.
<b>Young Six</b>: [murmuring]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Did you hear something?
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: It sounded like it came from over there!
[door creaks]
<b>Young Six</b>: [grunt]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: You again. As I suspected.
[magic surging]
<b>Young Six</b>: [scream]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended.
[door opens]
[thud]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Since you refuse to explain your 
plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay 
here while I summon your guardians to take you home.
<b>Sandbar</b>: Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now.
<b>Smolder</b>: What are you saying?!
<b>Silverstream</b>: Sandbar?!
<b>Sandbar</b>: I don't want anything to do with <i>creatures</i> that could threaten Equestria!
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Wisely put, colt.
[magic surging]
<b>Chancellor Neighsay</b>: Everypony will come to their senses eventually.
[door closes]
[thud]
[thud]
[multiple thuds]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [yawns]
[clatter!]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: What in tarnation?!
<b>Sandbar</b>: Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.
<b>Sandbar</b>: Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If 
you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. 
Will you help me?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Do mulberries have seeds?
[beat]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: That's a yes.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How about you tell us what you know or 
you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony
 can open the door?
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that.
<b>Spike</b>: We're just as trapped as Tirek?
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: [chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.
<b>Mane Six</b> and <b>Spike</b>: [gasp]
<b>Applejack</b>: Which little protégé?
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: And you answered them?!
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
[thud]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?
<b>Lord Tirek</b>: Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is...
<b>Sandbar</b>: Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.
[clang!]
<b>Sandbar</b> and <b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [gasp]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm 
sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to 
ruin all my plans.
<b>Sandbar</b> and <b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [gasp]
<b>Cozy Glow</b>: You might get some company soon, if I can't make that annoying Neighsay <i>back off!</i>
 [inhales, exhales] All this magic needs time to drain from Equestria 
before my vortex sucks it to another realm. [giggles] Three days can 
sure seem like forever, huh? You know, you ponies got it all wrong. 
Friendship isn't magic. Friendship is <i>power!</i> With Twilight and her lackeys out of my way, all of Equestria will bow to <i>me!</i> The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]
[to be continued]
