<b>Shopkeeper</b>: May I help you, traveler? Hmm, something 
drew you to my shop... something powerful. Ah, you have a keen eye. The 
Alicorn Amulet is one of the most mysterious and powerful of all the 
known magical charms. Uh, ah— I'm afraid this is... <i>far</i> too dangerous.
[bits clinking]
<b>Shopkeeper</b>: [quickly] Would you like that gift-wrapped?
[theme song]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Don't be scared, little friends. Twilight is wonderful with magic. [to Twilight] Anything happens to them, Twilight, <i>so help me</i>...
<b>Spike</b>: Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic 
has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack 
with a giant snowball.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Of course she's good with magic. Twilight's 
great with magic. I guess I just don't want my little friends to be 
scared. Oh, oh, look how scared they are!
[animals chittering]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I promise, Fluttershy. Nothing bad will happen to them.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [high-pitched] I know! Stop, stop! They can't take it!
[animals chittering and cheering]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [teeth chattering]
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight, that looks amazing!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Phew!
[animals chittering]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's all for now, little ones. Maybe we can practice again later, if Fluttershy says it's alright.
[animals chittering]
<b>Spike</b>: Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight. Princess Celestia's going to love it.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Thanks, Spike. I have to be at my best when she arrives with the delegates from Saddle Arabia. I can't believe she's trusting <i>me</i> with the entertainment.
[thud]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Twilight! Come quick! It's an emergency!
[poof]
<b>Rarity</b>: [gasp] You beast! This shade of brown should only be used for accents!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Come on, Applejack. We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What's going on here?
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, well, well. If it isn't... Twilight Sparkle.
[ponies gasp]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps] Trixie!
<b>Spike</b>: What's <i>she</i> doing here?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You call <i>that</i> great and powerful?
[poof]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yelps]
<b>Snips</b>: Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!
<b>Snails</b>: Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yelps]
<b>Snails</b>: Good spell, oh Great and Powerful Trixie!
<b>Trixie</b>: You two! Quiet!
[poof]
<b>Snips</b>: Uh, hey! W— What happened?
<b>Snails</b>: Get off of me! Brbrbr.
<b>Snips</b>: Let go!
<b>Snails</b>: Go this way!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!
<b>Trixie</b>: You and I have some unfinished business. My 
magic's gotten better since I was here last. And I'm going to prove it! 
Me and you, a magic duel. Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville <i>forever</i>!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Forget it! I'd never make a deal like that!
<b>Trixie</b>: Hm. Your choice.
<b>Spike</b>: [yelps]
[stretching noise]
[bouncing]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this?
<b>Trixie</b>: Why? Because you <i>humiliated</i> me! After you
 showed me up with that Ursa Minor, I became a laughing stock! 
Everywhere I went I was laughed at and ostracized. I even had to take a 
job on a rock farm just to earn a living! A <i>rock farm</i>!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! You're <i>lucky</i> a rock farm would take the likes of you!
[click and drag sounds]
<b>Trixie</b>: <i>Now</i> I want revenge! And I'll just keep casting spells 'til you agree. Well? What do you say?
[Snails and Rainbow Dash grunting]
<b>Spike</b>: Whoooaah! Help... me!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Alright, Trixie. Let's duel!
<b>Trixie</b>: Excellent.
[thud]
<b>Rarity</b>: [crying]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [indignant muffled noises]
<b>Trixie</b>: If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again. But if <i>you</i> lose, <i>you're</i> the one banished from this one-horse town!
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [gasps]
[tense music]
<b>Trixie</b>: Draw!
[poof]
[ponies gasping]
<b>Shoeshine</b>: [Wilhelm scream]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts] Phew. [gasps]
[poik]
[parasprite burping]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [exhales]
[snow melting]
<b>Rest of main cast</b>: [laughing]
[snip, snip]
<b>Trixie</b>: Snips, Snails, step forward!
<b>Snips</b>: Wh— what is it, oh Great and P— P— Powerful Trixie? [laughs nervously]
<b>Baby Snips</b>: [crying]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns!
[wiping noise]
<b>Trixie</b>: Well, Twilight? Give up?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [sighs] [grunts]
<b>Baby Snips</b>: [surprised noise]
<b>Spike</b>: Come on, Twilight, you can do it!
[magic sputtering]
[thud]
<b>Baby Snips</b>: [crying]
<b>Old Snails</b>: [spine clicking]
<b>Trixie</b>: Trixie <i>is</i> the highest level unicorn! [laughs] And now it's time for <i>you</i> to <i>leave</i> Ponyville! FOREVER!
<b>Applejack</b>: That's <i>enough</i>, Trixie!
<b>Rarity</b>: You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!
<b>Trixie</b>: You fools! She's already gone!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps]
[pop]
[thud]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It's okay, guys. I'll figure something
 out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's 
something strange about her.
<b>Spike</b>: Twilight? [thunk]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts of exertion] Ugh! It's 
impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I 
can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I 
know who understands strange and powerful magic?
[tribal music]
<b>Zecora</b>: Your tale of woe upsets me so. [sips] No wonder you're dour. It's an abuse of power!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.
<b>Zecora</b>: [sips] If you train with me, so good you'll be. I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>You'll</i> train me in magic? But she was doing <i>age</i> spells, <i>weather</i> spells, you name it!
<b>Zecora</b>: When it comes to magic, it would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially Trixie.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You really think I can beat her?
<b>Zecora</b>: Mm-hmm.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Okay, when do we start?
[banner unfurling]
<b>Trixie</b>: You two! Hurry up with my throne.
[splat]
<b>Trixie</b>: And <i>you</i>, how long do I have to wait for my applesauce facial?
<b>Applejack</b>: Forget it, Trixie! I ain't doing nothin' 'til
 you let Twilight come home! [laughs uncontrollably] Okay, I'll do it! 
Just make it stop! Hoo!
[crash]
<b>Trixie</b>: I thought I told you to dance!
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville. Ow! [whines] Oh, somepony has to help us!
[tribal music]
<b>Zecora</b>: Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss must 
interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned. Only then can 
victory be earned.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [grunts]
<b>Trixie</b>: [echoing] Trixie <i>is</i> the highest level unicorn! [laughs]
[splash]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [yelps]
[splash]
<b>Zecora</b>: There is much, much that I can teach, but the answer you need may still be out of reach.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best,
 but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something 
different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean 
and nasty.
<b>Zecora</b>: Your thinking needs a readjust. Total concentration is a must.
[banners flapping in wind]
[wind whistling]
<b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us <i>anywhere</i>.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [muffled noises]
<b>Applejack</b>: I hear you, Pinkie. I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.
<b>Spike</b>: Ugh, there must be something! Twilight has every magic book there is!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Um, I think I may have found something?
<b>Rarity</b>: Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic–
<b>Applejack</b>: She wants me to grow apples with no peels! Now how the hay am I supposed to do that?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Um, there's a picture here of that necklace–
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [muffled noises]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold—
<b>Spike</b>: Hey, everypony, look! This book has a picture of 
Trixie's necklace! It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it 
is blessed with untold powers!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] If you read a little further, you'll see—
<b>Rarity</b>: [reading] Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Yes, but, um, you can't—
<b>Spike</b>: [reading] You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet 
off her neck, it has a magical lock! Trixie's the only pony who can take
 it off!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Maybe we could—
<b>Applejack</b>: We need to get this information to Twilight. She'll know what to do.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] But, h— how—
<b>Rarity</b>: If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] Maybe we should—
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I've got it! Trying to sneak past the 
force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the 
goods to get into those woods!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [quietly] It— it must be—
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Fluttershy!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: <i>Whaaat</i>?!
[thud]
<b>Applejack</b>: What do you say, Fluttershy? Can you handle the mission?
<b>Fluttershy</b>: No! I'll crack under the pressure! I'll snap like a twig!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight.
<b>Fluttershy</b>: But— but I, I—
[thud]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [teeth chattering] [sighs] Okay.
<b>Applejack</b>: Alright!
<b>Other ponies and Spike</b>: [general agreement]
<b>Rarity</b>: I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit!
<b>Snips</b> and <b>Snails</b>: [grunts of exertion]
<b>Trixie</b>: Pull, you fools! [cracks whip] Somepony set off the magic force field, and Trixie intends to punish them!
<b>Snips</b>: [gasping] But... wouldn't it be faster if we had some... <i>wheels</i>?!
<b>Trixie</b>: The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels. Now pull faster!
<b>Snails</b>: [gasping] I'm telling ya, Snips, she's getting weirder and weirder!
[whip cracking]
<b>Snips</b> and <b>Snails</b>: [grunts of exertion]
<b>Trixie</b>: Stop! You there! What are you doing?!
[beaver chittering angrily]
[thud]
[poof]
<b>Snails</b>: Gah, why is she so mean to us?
<b>Snips</b>: Yeah! I miss the days when she was just a fraud!
[whip cracking]
[grinding noises]
[beaver chittering]
[pop]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, oh dear! Rarity's dangerous mission outfit is ruined! Guess we'd better go back! [laughs nervously]
[beaver chittering]
[birds tweeting]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, okay, okay, you're right. I need to be brave and find Twilight.
[bird tweeting]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh! Y— you found her?
[bird tweeting]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: She's in the Everfree Forest?!
[whoosh]
[pop]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: Oh, this <i>is</i> me being brave! I wanna be brave at <i>home</i>, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!
[tribal music]
<b>Fluttershy</b>: [sips]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!
<b>Fluttershy</b>: The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!
<b>Zecora</b>: Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done. You 
learned all of my lessons; all but one. If Trixie's tricks have you in a
 fix, you must nix your magic and use the six.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Nix your magic, use the six... Nix 
your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a 
genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.
[scribbling]
[dragging noises]
<b>Trixie</b>: This better not be another false alarm, or the Great and Powerful Trixie will– [gasps] <i>You</i>! [muffled] What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle? Not enjoying your exile?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.
<b>Trixie</b>: Cheated? <i>Moi</i>?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a <i>real</i>
 magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from 
beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than 
your measly little Alicorn Amulet!
<b>Trixie</b>: Ha! Nothing's more powerful than the Alicorn Amulet! And nopony's more powerful than the Great and Powerful Trixie!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?
<b>Trixie</b>: [muffled] Why should I? I already beat you.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora.
<b>Trixie</b>: Wait!
[poof]
<b>Trixie</b>: Okay, okay, you're on! A second duel.
[thunder rumbles]
[lightning cracks]
[hoof stomps]
<b>Trixie</b>: Let's start with a simple age spell, shall we?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Let's.
<b>Trixie</b>: Snips, Snails.
[poof]
<b>Baby Snips</b> and <b>Baby Snails</b>: [crying]
<b>Trixie</b>: An oldie, but a goodie, ha. Now, let's see what <i>your</i> little charm can do.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please?
<b>Applejack</b>: Huh?
<b>Rarity</b>: Huh?
[scratching]
[magic zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: Oh, ho-hum. So you can do an age spell, big deal.
[magic zap]
[magic zap]
[magic zap]
[magic zap]
<b>Trixie</b>: That's... That's impossible!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's nothing!
[magic zap]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yow!
<b>Trixie</b>: How did you–
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Duplication spell. Ever see <i>one</i> pony play <i>ten</i> instruments?
[magic zap]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [plays one-pony band]
<b>Trixie</b>: This... just can't be!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion.
[magic zap]
<b>Big McIntosh</b> (as <b>Male Applejack</b>): (nervously) Eeyup.
[magic zap]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yours– Hey! Give it back!
<b>Trixie</b>: [laughs] With this amulet, I shall now rule all of Equestria!
[click]
[electricity sparking]
[click]
<b>Trixie</b>: Witness, my subjects. Gaze upon an ever greater and 'powerful-er' Trixie!
[lightning cracks]
<b>Trixie</b>: Hey! [scoffs] I don't need that old Alicorn Amulet. I have <i>this</i>!
[weak electricity crackling]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughs] Stop it! Tha— that tickles!
<b>Trixie</b>: Tickles?! That was supposed to make you writhe in agony! This amulet is defective! [magic zap] Give mine back!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sorry. This is going back into hiding where it belongs.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops.
[rock shattering]
<b>Trixie</b>: [upset] But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells!
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You're right. Not even me. Zecora 
taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me 
when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the
 Alicorn Amulet head to head, so <i>I needed to use a different kind of magic – the magic of friendship.</i> I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you.
<b>Trixie</b>: But... what about the pony with the ten instruments?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [continues playing one-pony band]
[ponies cheering]
[birds singing]
[ponies in awe]
<b>Saddle Arabian delegates</b>: Oooh!
[fireworks exploding]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Trixie?
<b>Trixie</b>: It's the least I could do. I treated you and 
your friends so horribly when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet. I just 
couldn't control myself. You can forgive me, can't you?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Hmmm. Sure.
<b>Trixie</b>: Oh, good. Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you've ever seen?!
[poof]
[thud]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [angry muffled yells]
[poof]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [inhales]
