<b>Meadow Song</b>: Puh-leeeez put your hooves together for your next performer, Maud Pie!
[applause]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [taps on microphone] [deadpan] What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?
[beat]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: Earth pony.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] But seriously, being an Earth pony 
isn't so bad. We've got magic powers, too. Like walking around and 
picking stuff up with our teeth.
[confused murmuring]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] That's sarcasm, by the way.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] It's funny, 'cause it's true!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] My favorite thing to listen to is 
clastic rock – the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to 
create sandstone, shale, and breccia. It sounds something like this.
[feedback]
[beat]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] And that's my time.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?
[beat, ponies burst into uproarious laughter]
[theme song]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] How was my... timing?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughing] You got me! C'mon, let's 
celebrate sister-style. We can get matching stickers that says "Eyes on 
the Pies", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I
 could plan for tomorrow if you want.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Actually, I'm busy tonight.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aww, that's what you said yesterday. And the day before that. And the day <i>before</i>
 the day before that. [sighs] It's just, we haven't hung out in a really
 long time because you always have other plans. Even when you promised 
to build whipped-cream pyramids with me.
[spraying]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The reason is I have a—
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Apology accepted, as long as we get some 
serious sister time before your birthday. And there's, uh, definitely no
 reason I wanna hang out before your birthday. Just, you know, not 
planning anything special.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Okay.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What about tomorrow morning?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Okay.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yay! Just you and me. Best sister friends forever!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Best sister friends forever.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I can't wait for tomorrow to be today. [extended squeal]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [continues squealing] Tomorrow is today! 
Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner? The answer is "you"!
 I would also accept "Maud". Maud? Maud!
[echoes]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Oh, I get it! We're playing hide-and-go-seek!
[music]
[barrel clattering]
[splashing]
[zoom]
[thud]
[knock, knock, knock, knock]
[door opens]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aha! Found you!
[crash]
[clattering]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Where's Maud? I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan! She has to be here!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Nope, it's just me. Reading.
[pages flipping]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Story checks out. Or <i>does</i> it?! It does. But are you sure there's nopony hiding... <i>in your closet?!</i>
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Pinkie, I don't <i>have</i> a closet. Is everything okay?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No. I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And ruin her surprise party?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I wasn't gonna tell her <i>why</i>, silly. But now I can't even <i>find</i> Maud. I'm usually <i>way</i> better at hide-and-seek than this.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Oh, she probably just found a new 
rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You
 take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Really? Thanks, Starlight!
[flowerpot clattering]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Just checking.
[door opens]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering] I've gotta get very important 
ingredients for a very important pony's cake. And it's gotta be 
tippy-top super-duper secret.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, it's not your turn yet.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Um, whatcha doin'?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rrrrrright. Okay. Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What <i>are</i> you doing anyway?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I am currently speaking to a—
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I mean, can I help you move this along? What
 are you looking for? Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with 
tails and fins?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: [to S06E12 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #3] Goodbye.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>That's</i> what you've been standing here all this time to say?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I was deciding between "goodbye" and "see you later".
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh... but, they're the same thing.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, they're very different. "See you 
later" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other. 
"Goodbye" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a 
conversation.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yyyyyeah, same thing.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I will not apologize for speaking with precision.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: In that case, apology not accepted. Goodbye, later, see ya—same thing!
[door slams]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ugh! Can you believe that guy?! Huh? "Out to Lunch"?! Oh, come on!
[door opens]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans] No Maud, no cake, no anything! And 
how annoying was that pony? Who takes so long to say goodbye? Or was it 
"see ya later"? Ugh! Now he's got <i>me</i> doing it!
[bump]
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maud! Found you! My turn to hide! Hee-hee!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, pssh. What are you apologizing to <i>me</i> for? I'm not upset, you silly-willy.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] The reason is I met somepony—
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wanna hang out right now? I mean, I can see 
you're not doing anything with anypony else. Unless they're invisible or
 reeeeeaaaally small.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A wha...?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] A boyfriend.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A whaaa...?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] A boyfriend.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A whaaaaa...?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] A boyfriend.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's so exciting! My sister, in love!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Technically, we're in "like".
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Tell me everything! Who is he? What's his 
favorite color? Does he like ice cream? If he were a bird, what kind of 
bird would he be? Wait. Is he <i>actually</i> a bird? Oh! I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You'll like him. We have a lot in common.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, I love <i>you</i>, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend! Oh, I can't wait to meet him!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You don't have to.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] He's a rock! And you love rocks, so it's perfect! [gasps] Is Boulder jealous?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] No. Behind the rock. Mudbriar, are you back there?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, not anymore.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] A wha-<i>whaaaaaaaaa</i>?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, we've already met.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You?!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: M'yes.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: M'yes.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You...
<b>Mudbriar</b>: M'yes.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I mean, [laughs] you! You, you, you!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I know.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] At a rock show.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! You're into rocks, too?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: No. I like sticks.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Then why were you at a rock show?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpanly happy] Except that in the 
per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is 
replaced with silicates – i.e., rocks.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: While retaining the original structural elements of wood – q.e.d., it was a stick show.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting piñatas! Haaaaa...
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Pinkie...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! You wanna go first?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: That is stick abuse.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, we've already met.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! Your pet likes fetch!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: This <i>is</i> my pet. So no.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: They're adorable.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Don't be rude.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. [through gritted teeth] I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, we've already met.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [growls, snort]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: So does Maud.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Boulder has <i>ten</i> times the personality
 of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like 
Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Yep, that's Maud.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But <i>this</i> guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, that also sounds like Maud.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is <i>nothing</i> like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Well, Maud obviously likes <i>something</i> about him.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's easy – nothing!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I guess...
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>That</i> I can do!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!
[crash]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Oof!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No reason. Wheeeeeee!
[crash]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: [groans]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Welcome to my party planning cave!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Yeah, okay.
[squeaking]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise 
party – edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble piñata.
 Uh... we'll skip that one.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Might I make some suggestions?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hmph. Let me see this "vision board".
<b>Mudbriar</b>: It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it.
 [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and 
enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and 
what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out
 loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Where does it say that? She never told me that!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, I never said that.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think <i>I'm</i> the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Can you be more specific?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No!
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Huh. You must be Mudbriar.
[beat]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!
[beat]
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time
 bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming 
besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could 
settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh]
 you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] <i>wrong he is?!</i>
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I like surprise parties...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hmmmm.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: See? Wait, what?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Mm-mm.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [whispering] Maybe you should consider, I 
don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because 
he's kinda sort of... [loudly] <i>impossible to like?!</i>
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is—
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] I didn't <i>choose</i> either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] "Technically"?! Ugh, you even like the way he <i>talks</i>?
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...
<b>Starlight Glimmer</b>: Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>No!</i> [crying]
<b>Mudbriar</b>: See you later!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!
<b>Fluttershy's apparition</b>: <i>I'm not shy, and I hate animals!</i>
<b>Rarity's apparition</b>: <i>Fashion?! Not for me, darling!</i>
<b>Applejack's apparition</b>: <i>Peh! An apple a day is downright disgusting!</i>
<b>Rainbow Dash's apparition</b>: <i>Slow and steady wins the race!</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle's apparition</b>: <i>I never learned to read!</i>
<b>Mane five's apparitions</b>: [laughing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: What if I don't like cupcakes?! [screams]
[rooster crows]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Good morning! Oh, wait. <i>Bad</i> morning. [groans]
[door opens]
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: Get out of bed, sis. If you're gonna be here, you gotta work.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ohhh.
[pickaxe clinking]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
<b>Marble Pie</b>: Mm-hmm.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, it all started when—
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: Less talking, more farming!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: I'm not jealous! Who said anything about jealous?!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Don't be! He's super-duper weird! And 
somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him. And now I'll never get to see 
her again! [sighs] I came home because you two know her better than 
anypony. What am I missing? What does she see in him? [tearing up] What 
does he have that I don't?! [starts bawling]
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: Buck up, Pinkie Pie. You look as miserable as I feel <i>all the time</i>.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [sniffs]
[splash]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It's just that I love Maud, and I <i>want</i> to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!
[beat]
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: Ugh, fine! We're taking a work break. Come on!
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock. See it?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean that lumpy grey one?
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: No, the beautiful blue and white one. Right there.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, <i>or</i> white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay.
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: [to Marble] Show her.
[rock cracks]
[glistening]
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: It's a geode! The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't.
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: It's a metaphor, Pinkie! You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you <i>can</i> see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters.
<b>Marble Pie</b>: Mm-hmm!
[rock clinks]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!
[thud]
<b>Limestone Pie</b>: Okay, okay! You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!
[paper rustling]
[whirring hooves]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I
 was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for 
Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Oh, come on!</i> [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!
<b>Mudbriar</b>: And I <i>love</i> a good quercus. Friends?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Friends! Now, do you have any ideas for the party?
<b>Mudbriar</b>: There is one.
[music]
[ponies chattering]
[door opens]
<b>Crowd</b>: Surprise!
[indistinct talking]
<b>Background pony 1</b>: Can you believe this punch? Oh, it's so good!
<b>Background pony 2</b>: Another great party!
<b>Background pony 3</b>: I know!
<b>Background pony 4</b>: Yeah!
<b>Maud Pie</b>: [deadpanly happy] This is my favorite party ever.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea. He
 said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you 
didn't have to go to.
<b>Mudbriar</b>: Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [through gritted teeth] Technically... [normally] You're right!
