Parental Glideance
Season 7
<b>Cutie Mark Crusaders</b>: [straining]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [straining] Scootaloo... is this such a... good idea?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: What are you talking about? This is the best idea I've ever had!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [grunting] It's just...
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Right, but...
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I think we're good.
[rubber band straining]
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: We are? Scootaloo, I know you have to go to
 Cloudsdale to finish your report. I'm just wonderin' if this is the 
best way to get there.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: It'll be fine. Besides, how <i>else</i> could I get there?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: A Pegasus chariot?
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: A flock of birds?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: A hot-air balloon?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Huh. Those <i>do</i> seem a lot safer. Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Woo-hoo!
[poof]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [grunts, weakly] Nailed it.
[lawnmower humming]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: [echoing] Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?
[head rattling]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] You're... You're... You're... <i>Rainbow Dash's dad!</i>
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Uh, yes. Bow Hothoof at your service.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [screams loud and long, fades out]
[theme song]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [continues screaming]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Uh, honey? Somethin's goin' on out here!
[door opens]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [stops screaming, resumes screaming at a higher pitch]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh! Heavens to Celestia, what's wrong with her?!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I don't know, but you just made it worse.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Sorry! It's just you're... <i>Rainbow Dash's parents!</i> [resumes screaming]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: She's doing it again!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, dearie, please! You might shatter my Princess Celestia commemorative plates! Ow!
[plates cracking]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [stops screaming] I'm so sorry. I just... 
[squeals] I can't believe I'm meeting you! My name's Scootaloo, and I'm 
doing a school report on your daughter! [ding]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Our Rainbow Dash?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: The report's on an inspirational pony in my 
life, and nopony inspires me more than she does! I'm putting together 
this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoa! You always wear that shirt?
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: My name's Windy Whistles, and I just 
have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow
 Dash as much as we do!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: What can we help you with?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know <i>anything</i> about her life before that.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Well, you came to the right place!
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Here you go! Rainbow Dash's favorite meal! A pasta and potato sandwich on sourdough! She just loved to carbo-load. [giggles]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's 
favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's
 childhood kitchen! <i>This is the greatest day of my life!</i> [munches loudly] Mmmm!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I think it's time for a tour of the house.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [mouth full] Okay.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious. The combination was—
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: [singsongy] Exciting!
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoa... Is that... her room?
[door opens]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [screams] Rainbow Dash's linen closet! Her carpet! Her inspirational poster! [reading] "<i>When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells.</i>" That's so Rainbow Dash!
[camera flashing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Woo-hoo!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Scootaloo, wanna see something <i>really</i> cool?
[curtain opens]
[door opens]
[heavenly choir singing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps]
[door closes]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I, uh, installed the sound effects myself. [chuckles]
[door opening and closing, heavenly choir turning on and off]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Pretty great, huh?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So great!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: And look at this! She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So cool!
[camera flashes]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.
[camera flashes]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth! [gasps] So many memories!
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You're so lucky to have all of these!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those "Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville" headlines like you.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Trade-sies?
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Deal-sies!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: No. I mean, where's all the stuff about 
Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then 
getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your 
daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Uhhhhhhhhh...
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, wow! You should see your faces right now!
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: See? That's what your faces look like.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!
[heavenly choir singing]
[door closes]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Great timing.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Great door.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: I just... It's... Unbelievable!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash <i>you</i> know. Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash <i>I</i> know.
[Wonderbolts' theme playing]
<b>Spitfire</b>: Let's make some thunder!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I was <i>born</i> to make thunder!
[thunder strikes]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Our baby's a Wonderbolt!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: [cheering loudly]
<b>Spitfire</b>: We've got turbulence!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: How? Where's it coming from?
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I'm so proud!
<b>Misty Fly</b>: There!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: [cheering loudly] She's a Wonderbolt!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Oh, no.
<b>Spitfire</b>: Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, how did you know I was here?
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: And these must be your Wonderbolt 
friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt
 ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Moooom!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [chuckles]
<b>Spitfire</b>: Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Nice to meet you as well, and love those
 goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly 
just for swimming. Oh, and bath time.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Dad, hold it together. We're in public.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: I know! I know, i— but it's... just... You had a goal, and... you achieved it! [sobs]
[camera flashes]
<b>Spitfire</b>: All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!
<b>Fleetfoot</b>: Sir, you really raised a great flyer!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Oh, no! [straining] Tears... welling up again!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Dad!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: [continues sobbing]
[camera flashes]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Could you give us a sec?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Is something wrong?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Why?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a 
delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close, 
but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a 
little bit... embarrassing.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Huh? Really?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: What's wrong with a little support?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hi!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Hello.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Greetings, small ponies.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And she earned it! Did you know it all 
started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training
 under Spitfire?
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: I didn't know that! How wonderful!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, no!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Hooray again!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was 
worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he 
framed her for a crime she didn't commit.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, no!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her
 innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and
 she became an <i>official</i> Wonderbolt!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Show's about to start.
[Wonderbolts' theme playing]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: [hooting]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Come on, Bolts! Let's start this thing!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Wonderbolts' Big Showcase! Here! We! Gooooooooo!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Rip it up and tear! It! Down!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: [cheering loudly]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: You go, girl!
<b>Fleetfoot</b>: [to Rainbow] Your folks were definitely loud, but they weren't <i>that</i> bad.
[fireworks]
<b>Spitfire</b>: Whoa! Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uhhhh, we didn't.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>:
Attagirl!
Yeah!
Go-go-go-go-go!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>:
Woo-hoo!
Go, girl! Go, girl, you got it!
You're a Wonderbolt!
<b>Fleetfoot</b>: Wow...
[crowd chattering]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Go, Rainbow Dash! You sign that photo! Whoo!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!
[camera flashes]
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: The camera loves you! Yeah!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Now, let's do the pyramid! Scootaloo, get up there! You're the top!
<b>Spitfire</b>: [to Rainbow] You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans. Lucky you.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans]
[locker door opens]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: You hung that towel!
[clang!]
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Yeah!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Greatest towel hanger of all time! [chanting] Towel!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: [chanting] Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Tow—
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Stop! This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive! This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt! You're just... too much!</i>
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Did... Did we do something wrong?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Yes! The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!</i>
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: We're just trying to be supportive.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Well, I'm tired of it! I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do!</i> [pants] I think you should leave.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie. No one [sniffs] can make their parents feel more worthless than you!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: [through tears] Your words were direct, clear, and... so painful! Is there nothing you can't do?!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Why?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Scootaloo, you don't understand!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out! I'll find somepony <i>else</i> to do my hero report on.
[sad music]
[scooter revving]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [panting] Scootaloo, wait! I know I wasn't
 myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents! That's 
exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I don't understand. They're so proud of you.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Can I tell you something?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Sure.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your 
wings because this could rock you to your very core. Believe it or not, 
there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: See this picture? It looks like I won something awesome, but actually...
<b>Announcer</b>: And last, but not least, it's time to hand out our participant stickers!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>:
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, Rainbow Dash!
You show 'em!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>:
Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
Hooray!
Yeah!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Greatest participant ever!
<b>Young "Dumb-Bell"</b>: Uh, your parents realize you didn't win, don't they?
[camera flashes]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Granted, I was the youngest pony in the 
senior competitive circuit. Most other ponies my age were still in the 
Junior Flappers' Club. I thought it was utterly mortifying having my 
parents cheer me on even when I lost!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [voiceover] But then, when I started to <i>win</i> competitions – which didn't take very long, by the way – things got even worse!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>:
Yeah!
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah, Rainbow Dash, you show 'em!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>:
Whoo!
Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
Woo-hoo-hooo! Yeah!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [voiceover] Being the best came with consequences. Very loud, very embarrassing consequences.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Ya know, some ponies would <i>dream</i> of having parents like that.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, right! Name one!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs] Me. Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at <i>any</i>thing,
 because nopony ever told me. But your parents told you over and over 
again. Look! Best bath taker ever. Best carrot eater under three. 
Greatest napper of all time!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [scoffs] I <i>am</i> pretty good at napping. I can fall asleep anywhere. [snores] Huh?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You're right. I was always so embarrassed 
by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the 
awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And
 I took them for granted.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: <i>And</i> you yelled at them.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [groans] I gotta make this right. I have 
an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. That is, if you're willing to 
help me after I acted like that.
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Now, that's a great picture! "Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways"!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing. Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: It's true. You must tell me what kind of knot you used. Uh, falconer's knot? Wait, no! A farmer's loop!
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: What's this all about, anywho?
[microphone feedback]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [over loudspeaker] <i>Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event!</i>
 [clears throat] Mom and Dad, welcome to the... [quickly] "I Love My 
Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They 
Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them"... 
[normally] event. Enjoy!
[Wonderbolts' theme music]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thanks for doing this.
<b>Spitfire</b>: Happy to help.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b> and <b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oooh... Ahhh... Oh! Ooh! [more awed excitement sounds]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm <i>your</i> biggest fan.
<b>Windy Whistles</b>: Oh, honey, thank you. But you didn't have to do all this. It's kind of [whispers] embarrassing.
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>: Eh, it <i>is</i> a bit much.
[camera flashes]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!
[applause]
<b>Cheerilee</b>: Thank you, Scootaloo. Very well researched! 
But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in 
your report. [chuckles] Um, I'll give you a B.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah! Greatest report giver of all time!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>, <b>Windy Whistles</b>, and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [chanting] Scootaloo! Scootaloo! Scootaloo!
<b>Bow Hothoof</b>, <b>Windy Whistles</b>, and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>:
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
Scootaloo!
<b>Cheerilee</b>:
Keep it down!
Okay!
This isn't a rock-and-roll concert!
Please!
