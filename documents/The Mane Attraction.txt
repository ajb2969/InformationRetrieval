[various creaking and squeaking sounds]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: And thanks to Pinkie's connections 
organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for 
the Helping Hooves Music Festival.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. <i>Everypony!</i>
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: What is it, Pinkie?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, spill it, Pinkie!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly 
difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all 
of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music 
Festival!
<b>Applejack</b>: Sapphire Shores?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the <i>second</i> biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, <i>Countess Coloratura!</i>
<b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Rarity</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Ahhh...
<b>Applejack</b>: Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
<b>Sweetie Drops</b> and <b>Lyra Heartstrings</b>: [gasps]
<b>Amethyst Star</b>: [gasps]
<b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Noteworthy</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Royal Riff</b>, <b>Spike</b>, <b>Sprinkle Medley</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [gasps]
[poing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: My frizz has been freaked!
[theme song]
<b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, I just <i>told</i> you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-<i>how</i> have you not heard of her?!
<b>Applejack</b>: Don't know. Though I did know a gal named 
Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just
 be the funniest thing if <i>that</i> Coloratura and <i>this</i> Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you mean to tell me that you actually <i>know</i> Countess Coloratura?
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you remember her cutie mark?
<b>Applejack</b>: Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean... like <i>this</i>?!
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Do you have any idea the number of hoops I 
had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot 
of hoops! That pony is very demanding!
<b>Applejack</b>: Nah.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: <i>Yah!</i>
<b>Rarity</b>: I completely understand. We <i>artistes</i> require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
<b>Applejack</b>: This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!
<b>Fluttershy</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b>, <b>Rainbow Dash</b>, <b>Rarity</b>, <b>Royal Riff</b>, <b>Spike</b>, <b>Sprinkle Medley</b> and <b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: <i>Rara?!</i>
<b>Applejack</b>: Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Colo<i>ra</i>tu<i>ra</i> to "Rara"!
[foals shouting]
<b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!
[splat]
<b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.
[splashing]
<b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for
 the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in 
the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!
<b>[Young Coloratura]</b>
Equestria, the land I love
A land of harmony
Our flag does wave from high above
For ponykind to see

Equestria, a land of friends
Where ponykind do roam
They say true friendship never ends
Equestria, my home

[ting]
[ponies cheering]
<b>Applejack</b>: [voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but...
<b>Applejack</b>: ...then we lost touch. But Rara always did 
want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? 
Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a 
plain old pony like you and me.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I don't have to wait – <i>she's here!</i>
<b>Applejack</b>: Really?
[pop music BGM]
[rumbling and clanking]
<b>Applejack</b>: Rara?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [squealing] Countess Coloratura!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Clear the way! Stand back! Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves!
[cameras clicking]
<b>Applejack</b>: No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname "Rara"?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: AJ?
<b>Applejack</b>: Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!
<b>Svengallop</b>: [unintelligible whispering]
[splat]
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Hoofsies! [short laugh]
<b>Rarity</b>: Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Hoofsies! Hoofsies! Hoofsies! [short laugh]
<b>Applejack</b>: Yeah... real special.
<b>Svengallop</b>: Now <i>that's</i> how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was <i>muddied</i> a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually <i>know</i> her?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara.
<b>Svengallop</b>: Oh, yes, how cute and... <i>common</i>. Of course, <i>I</i> was the one that started calling you <i>Countess</i>,
 and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why, 
you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is
 the pony Pinkie Pie?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr. Manager, sir!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I have twenty glass containers full right here!
[clink]
<b>Svengallop</b>: Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw <i>Fernando</i>.
[flamenco music]
<b>Svengallop</b>: Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the 
rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs
 her run-through, shall we?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Ooh, we shall!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot
 gardens... Chocolate éclairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of
 crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry
 Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Abso-toot-ly!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: See, Applejack? Demanding!
<b>Applejack</b>: Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew 
didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up 
imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change.
<b>Applejack</b>: She's become a whole other pony!
<b>Rarity</b>: Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!
<b>[Countess Coloratura]</b>
Time for the spectacle
Time for the show
The lights are bright and the colors glow

I'm not just anypony
I think you know
The time is now, it's about to blow!

Razzle dazzle
Glitz and glam
Turn it all up, it's a spectacle

Razzle dazzle
Glitz and glam
Turn it all up, it's a spectacle

Give me more
Razzle dazzle
Glitter eyes, big surprise
Lights, cameras

[vocalizing]

Razzle dazzle
Glitz and glam
Turn it all up, it's a spectacle

Hear the applause
Here to impress
Not just a pony, I am the Countess!

[ponies cheering]
<b>Applejack</b>: Rarity was right! I <i>don't</i> believe it!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that <i>I</i> designed, your performance was <i>spectacular</i>, Countess Coloratura!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, [short laugh], thank you, Svengallop!
<b>Applejack</b>: Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller
 isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and
 whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, 
Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess 
Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.
<b>Applejack</b>: If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Ugh. I can <i>totally</i> get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!
<b>Applejack</b>: The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of <i>you</i> will get a chance to sing with <i>me</i> onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun?
[foals cheering]
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies?
[foals cheering]
<b>Applejack</b>: Now <i>that's</i> more like the Rara <i>I</i> remember.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [distant] But... I got everything you requested!
<b>Svengallop</b>: <i>That</i> was for Countess Coloratura! <i>This</i> is for <i>me</i>! And what <i>I</i> want is <i>premium</i> oats!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!
<b>Svengallop</b>: I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by <i>apple</i> trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] But that's impossible!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Do you want me to <i>pull</i> Countess Coloratura from your little <i>podunk charity show</i>?! Because I will!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said—
<b>Applejack</b>: I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about <i>me</i>?!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom!
[beat]
<b>Applejack</b>: Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: [laughs]
<b>Applejack</b>: Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Sure, what about him?
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Svengallop works very hard as my 
manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't 
see anything wrong with that.
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him 
tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd 
pull you from our charity festival?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image!
<b>Applejack</b>: I'm afraid <i>Svengallop</i> doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: That's not true! Svengallop has 
always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things
 because you're jealous!
<b>Applejack</b>: Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a 
veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not 
jealous of that, Rara!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have <i>clearly</i> gone in different directions!
[squeaking and spinning]
<b>Applejack</b>: It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Enough stewin', more peelin'!
<b>Applejack</b>: Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [groans]
<b>Applejack</b>: Countess Coloratura!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Wow, AJ, you said my real name.
<b>Applejack</b>: I said your <i>new</i> name, but I saw the 
real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know 
somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Ugh, not this again.
<b>Applejack</b>: Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: And just how are you going to do that?
<b>Applejack</b>: Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop?
<b>Svengallop</b>: Here I am! Did you need something?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...?
<b>Svengallop</b>: Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest.
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: You... have?
<b>Svengallop</b>: You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that <i>I</i> built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [out of breath] Yes, Svengallop, sir! [coughs]
<b>Svengallop</b>: We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me!
[magic twinkling]
[thud]
<b>Svengallop</b>: Cancel the contest for the fillies and 
schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a 
rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the 
drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of!
[audio feedback]
<b>Svengallop</b>: [amplified] <i>You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!</i>
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: So <i>that's</i> how you've been managing things?
<b>Svengallop</b>: Yeah, so? What's the problem?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want!
<b>Svengallop</b>: But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: But not because you scare ponies 
into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would 
never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I 
would <i>never</i> cancel the schoolponies' contest!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little <i>Rara</i> I met back in Manehattan!
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: You clearly don't understand the real me!
<b>Svengallop</b>: Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without <i>me</i>? Good luck, <i>Countess Coloratura! Good luck.</i>
<b>Applejack</b>: Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?
<b>Countess Coloratura</b>: Of course. After all, the show must go on!
<b>Coloratura</b>: Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible!
<b>Applejack</b>: Can you give us a minute, Rarity?
<b>Rarity</b>: Certainly.
<b>Applejack</b>: Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?
<b>Coloratura</b>: Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing!
<b>Applejack</b>: Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a 
tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and 
acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a
 star. But the <i>real</i> perk of friendship is gettin' to see your 
friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, 
you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.
[crowd cheering]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: Good evening, everypony! Welcome to 
opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great 
honor to introduce you to our headlining act – Countess Coloratura!
[crowd cheering]
<b>Coloratura</b>: This song may be familiar, but yet, it's totally different. Kind of like me, Rara.
[ponies uttering confusion]
<b>[Coloratura]</b>
I'm here to show you who I am
Throw off the veil, it's finally time
There's more to me than glitz and glam, oh-whoa
And now I feel my stars align

For I had believed what I was sold
I did all the things that I was told
But all that has changed, and now I'm bold
'Cause I know

That I am just a pony
I make mistakes from time to time
But now I know the real me
And put my heart out on the line

And let the magic in my heart stay true
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
And let the magic in my heart stay true
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Just like the magic inside of you

And now I see those colors
Right before my eyes
I hear my voice so clearly
And I know that it is right

They thought I was weak, but I am strong
They sold me the world, but they were wrong
And now that I'm back, I still belong
'Cause I know

That I am just a pony
I make mistakes from time to time
But now I know the real me
And put my heart out on the line

And let the magic in my heart stay true
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
And let the magic in my heart stay true
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Just like the magic inside of you

Just like the magic inside of you...

[crowd cheering]
<b>Coloratura</b>: [amplified] Thank you, everypony! When I 
arrived at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I had forgotten who I 
really was! But then an old friend reminded me what real friendship is 
about, and she told me that if I was true to myself, I couldn't go 
wrong! So I have a very special surprise for her. Apple Bloom, Sweetie 
Belle, Scootaloo, come on up!
<b>[Coloratura and Cutie Mark Crusaders]</b>
Equestria, the land I love
A land of harmony
Our flag does wave from high above
For ponykind to see

Equestria, a land of friends
Where ponykind do roam
They say true friendship never ends
Equestria, my home
