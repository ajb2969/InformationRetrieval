<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la 
la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to 
do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to 
finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer 
marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be <i>amazing</i>!
<b>Gummy</b>: [licks]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream...
[cutie mark ringing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: An hour per layer – that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!
[oven opens and closes]
[cutie mark ringing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!
[cutie mark ringing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark! [gasps] You know what this means?! [hushed] <i>The map!</i>
<b>Gummy</b>: [licks]
[door shuts]
[door opens]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? 
Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for 
you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some 
of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the 
meringue!
[cutie mark ringing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I know you can do this, Gummy! You're the best alligator baker I've ever met! [kisses]
[door shuts]
<b>Gummy</b>: [creaking] [thud] [blinks]
[theme song]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: This is so exciting. The map is 
summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I 
don't know if either of you have read "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", 
but griffons were known to be—
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Rude, insensitive bullies?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: You mean Gilda?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, <i>especially</i> Pinkie Pie!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She <i>was</i> a bit of a party pooper.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Mm-hmm.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You
 still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a 
rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were 
known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other 
treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious 
golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the 
dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. 
Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. 
It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning 
Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: It was actually Gilda's visit that 
made me curious. So I picked up "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", and I've
 been hooked ever since! And now... [sigh] Now you two get to see 
Griffonstone with your very own eyes.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, you can totally take my place if you want. [yawn] I still have half a nap to finish.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you <i>are</i> the Princess of Friendship.
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: No, no, if the map wanted me to go to 
the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the 
actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing,
 I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is 
just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sigh] Fine...
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's the spirit! [blows party horn]
[train whistle]
[train chugging]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Whatcha reading, Rainbow?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Twilight literally wrote a <i>book</i> on what we need to do in Griffonstone.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And then some. It's like Twilight herself 
in book form. [imitating Twilight] "Always carry plenty of bits. The 
griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth."
[bits clinking]
[cart squeaking]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [swallows] Uh, can I borrow some bits?
[train chugging]
<b>Twilight Sparkle</b>: [voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon 
Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean
 Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in 
Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself
 to the king. "Bygone Griffons of Greatness" was written a long time 
ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the 
griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king 
you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help
 with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd 
try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if 
you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a 
bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And 
don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to 
be the <i>best</i>.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is...
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: ...a total dump!
[branch creaking]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Excuse me, sir? This <i>is</i> Griffonstone, right?
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, that wasn't very nice.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: See? These griffons are <i>exactly</i> like I'd thought they'd be.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.
<b>Gilda</b>: We don't have a king, losers.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hello, <i>Gilda</i>.
<b>Gilda</b>: <i>Dash</i>.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Pinkie!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What are you doing here?
<b>Gilda</b>: Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!
<b>Gilda</b>: Help it <i>what</i>?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and—
<b>Gilda</b>: Bored now!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?
<b>Gilda</b>: Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really <i>believe</i> in that thing.
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: You'd better believe in it! [coughs and wheezes]
[thump]
[door opens]
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: It was the best thing to ever happen to us griffons!
<b>Gilda</b>: Oh, <i>great</i>. Now you got Grampa Gruff started!
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: I'll tell you the whole tragic tale... [laughing] ...for a couple of bits.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs]
[bits clinking]
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: The first griffon king, King Grover, 
united our kind like we've never been united before or since! And he did
 it all with that incredible Idol of Boreas.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [stifled giggling]
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: That idol brought pride to the heart of 
every griffon that saw it! From one king to the next, Griffonstone had 
our golden idol. We were the envy of all other species. [narrating] It 
held us together – it gave us an identity – right up until the reign of 
King Guto.
[lightning cracks]
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: [narrating] That's when Arimaspi came to 
steal our griffon treasure! King Guto tried to fight him off, but 
Arimaspi managed to get away with the idol!
[lightning cracks]
<b>Arimaspi</b>: [bellows]
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: [narrating] They say when our treasure 
fell into the Abysmal Abyss, our pride went with it. King Guto was the 
last king of Griffonstone, and we all lived miserably ever after. The 
end!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!
<b>Grampa Gruff</b>: Aw, well... <i>Tough tailfeathers! No refunds!</i>
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?
[thump]
<b>Gilda</b>: It's not sad! Do we look sad to you?
[thump, scrabbling]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us
 here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back
 to Griffonstone!
<b>Gilda</b>: Ha-ha. Here we go – typical pony hero complex. 
None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't 
care about anything, and <i>that's</i> the way we like it!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!
<b>Gilda</b>: The only problem Griffonstone has <i>is you!</i>
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, I don't care what she says. We're 
gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to 
Ponyville! Come on!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What, taking a bunch of pictures?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: She mentioned finding answers at the library.
[thwap]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas.
[door opening]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!
[beat]
[door breaks]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss.
<b>Storekeeper</b>: And I'll need some bits.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!
<b>Gilda</b>: Word on <i>what</i> street?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Okay, maybe not <i>this</i> street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town.
<b>Gilda</b>: The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?!
[cart rattling]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't
 come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but 
Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk
 of gold. [as King Grover] <i>You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair!</i> [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!
[statue breaks]
[bonk!]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!
<b>Gilda</b>: Fewer ponies?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: A song! I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin! [inhales]
<b>Gilda</b>: Can't sing here!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?
<b>Gilda</b>: Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem – lack of uplifting musical numbers.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If 
there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your 
party store?
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?
<b>Gilda</b>: Ugh.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: No <i>singing</i>, no <i>party store</i>, no <i>bakery</i>?! <i>What is this place?!</i>
<b>Gilda</b>: You're welcome to leave [suddenly yelling] <i>at any time!</i>
[crash]
[thump]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!
<b>Gilda</b>: Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: I'll buy one! [chomp]
<b>Gilda</b>: Bits first!
[bit clinking]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [crunching]
<b>Gilda</b>: Well?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [crunching]
<b>Gilda</b>: What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [with mouth full] Ow! I think I broke a tooth!
<b>Gilda</b>: Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [spits] I can help you with that!
[wind blowing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?
<b>Storekeeper</b>: Can you give me more bits?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss?
<b>Storekeeper</b>: How deep are your pockets?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?
<b>Storekeeper</b>: Gimme some bits and I'll answer.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No wonder Gilda's such a delight.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient.
<b>Gilda</b>: Don't tell me. "Friendship"?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I 
never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll 
have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!
<b>Greta</b>: [sniffing]
[bonk!]
[thud]
<b>Gilda</b>: Greta!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!
<b>Gilda</b>: What are you talking about?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.
<b>Gilda</b>: What, <i>her</i>? Greta's just some griffon I 
know. We don't have friends here! [sighs] I did have a friend once, but 
you saw how that turned out.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!
<b>Gilda</b>: See ya.
[wind blowing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [shouting] You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
[rope snaps]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming] Whoooa!
[thump]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope!
<b>Storekeeper</b>: You got bits?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Wait! <i>Heeeeeelp...!</i> [fades into distance]
[bandage tightening]
[wind blowing]
[thump]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [frustrated yell]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [in distance] There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's <i>real</i> problem – scones!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Pinkie Pie, you get back here!
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [in distance] Yeah?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [in distance] Can you throw down a rope or something?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [in distance] Lemme look!
[beat]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: One rope coming up!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grumbles]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: We need help. Don't go anywhere!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sighs] Where does she think I'm gonna go?
[rock crumbles]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [panicked noises] I hope I don't go anywhere!
[scones sizzling]
<b>Gilda</b>: [chewing]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need <i>your</i> help to save her!
<b>Gilda</b>: Not my problem.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Of course it's your problem! She's your friend!
<b>Gilda</b>: Used to be.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Can't you remember when she <i>was</i>?
<b>Gilda</b>: Yeah. Of course.
<b>Young Hoops</b>: Doesn't that griffon know she's supposed to <i>fly</i> at the Junior Speedsters <i>Flight</i> Camp?
<b>Young Rainbow Dash</b>: Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...?
<b>Young Gilda</b>: Uh... G-G-G-G-Gilda.
<b>Young Rainbow Dash</b>: You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome!
<b>Young Gilda</b>: [laughing] You too, Rainbow Dash!
<b>Young Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!
[bowling pins clatter]
<b>Young Gilda</b>: <i>Junior Speedsters are our lives,</i>
<b>Young Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Skybound soars and daring dives,</i>
<b>Young Gilda</b> and <b>Young Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Junior Speedsters, it's our quest to someday be the very best!</i>
<b>Gilda</b>: Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Duly noted. [to the audience] Except it <i>does</i>!
[rock crumbling]
[wind blowing]
<b>Gilda</b>: Hang on, loser! I'm coming!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What took you so long, doofus?!
[rock crumbling]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Gotcha!
<b>Gilda</b>, <b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming]
[thump]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [grunting]
<b>Gilda</b>: Hold on, you two! [grunting] Huh? [gasps]
[metallic glint]
<b>Gilda</b>: The Idol of Boreas! [grunting]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm slipping!
<b>Gilda</b>: [straining]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b> and <b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [screaming]
<b>Gilda</b>: [grunting]
[thump]
[chink!]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: The idol!
<b>Gilda</b>: You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold.
[rock crumbling]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Hugging later, climbing <i>now</i>!
<b>Gilda</b>: I'm really sorry about how I treated you two.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thanks, Gilda.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Apology accepted.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's what I was trying to tell you! The 
map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here
 to replace it with something better!
<b>Gilda</b>: Nothing's better than gold to a griffon.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: That's because you don't have friendship! If
 you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a 
mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden
 idol to do that. You just need each other.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know.
<b>Gilda</b>: Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave 
her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the 
first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me!
[cutie marks ringing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Whoa, Pinkie. I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [in film reel quality] Baking powder makes baked goods and friendships fluffy and delicious! [squee]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Well, we'd better be heading home.
<b>Gilda</b>: What? Y-Y-You want me to spread friendship here 
by myself?! How am I supposed to do that?! I haven't even made one 
single friend yet!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No, you haven't. You've made <i>two</i>.
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [tearing up] Hugging! Hugging now!
<b>Gilda</b>: But you'll come back and visit, right?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Just try and stop us!
[creeeak, pop!]
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: [to statue] See ya later, you old charmer.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Uh, Pinkie? Who are you talking to?
<b>Pinkie Pie</b>: Nopony! Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe!
<b>Gummy</b>: [blinks]
