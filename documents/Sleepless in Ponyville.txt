[bits clinking]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [wings buzzing]
[ponies yelping]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoo-hoo!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [sips] Nice moves, kid.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've got–
[thud]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] ...nice moves!
<b>Bessie</b>: [moos]
[theme song]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: ...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, "Nice moves, kid."
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Woooow.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: She really said that?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I mean, it's like she practically told me she
 wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and 
become like my big sister!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: I dunno about all that.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: It was a really nice compliment and all, but...
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I know, I know. But all that stuff I said <i>could</i> happen, right?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Absolutely.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my <i>awesomeness</i>.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be 
campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis 
to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Really?!
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Sure!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I wanna go...
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Well, duh, of course you can go!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!
<b>Rarity</b>: I <i>despise</i> camping! All of that... [shudders] ...nature.
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Applejack's going with her little sister. But, y'know, if you don't wanna spend time with me... [squee]
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: See? Told you she'd wanna go.
[water running]
<b>Applejack</b>: You packed bug spray?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Yup. You got the canteens?
<b>Applejack</b>: Yup. Looks like we're all set then.
[cart trundling]
<b>Rarity</b>: Hey!
<b>Applejack</b>: Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when
 you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you 
didn't bring your eyelash curler.
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, looks like we're all set <i>now</i>.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?
<b>Applejack</b>: 'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh.
<b>Applejack</b>: Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!
<b>Rarity</b>: Oh, are we there yet?
<b>Applejack</b>: The last thousand times you asked that, the 
answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up 
there right now.
[crunch]
[thump]
[splash]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [quietly] Alright, Scootaloo, just play it cool. [normal] Hey Rai–
[wobbling noise]
[thud]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [clears throat] Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What took you guys so long?
<b>Applejack</b>: Well, <i>some</i> of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit.
[hammering]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Heh, if that's okay with you.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or [laughs nervously] night in my life.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
[pop]
[wind blowing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: You have <i>got</i> to be kidding me.
<b>Rarity</b>: Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [mimicking Rarity] Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood.
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Scootaloo</b>: [laughing]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Of course!
[fire lighting]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Okay, maybe it's the <i>second</i> best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest. [spookily] You like scary stories, <i>right</i>?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Mm-hmm.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this...
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: ...And then, The Olden Pony asked, [mimicking aged voice] "<i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe?</i>"
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: Not me!
[suspenseful pause]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>You do</i>!
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [screaming]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [laughing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [clears throat] Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Knew <i>you</i> wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me – fearless.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Yeah. Fearless. [teeth chattering]
[owl hoots]
<b>Rarity</b>: [coddling] Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh!
<b>Applejack</b>: [yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [trembling]
<b>Applejack</b>: Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!
[splash]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it.
[twig snaps]
[leaves rustling]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination...
[branches creaking]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony...
[wolf howling]
[zip]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snoring loudly]
[distant muttering]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: I-Is anyone out there?
[hoof stamps]
[branches creaking]
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: [mumbling]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasp] [panting]
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: Who got my rusty horseshoe?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasp] [panting] [neighs]
[roar]
[snap]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs]
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: <i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe</i>?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [cries] [dash] [panting] Rainbow Dash–?
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: <i>You do</i>!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [snores]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous humming]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous humming]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [yawns] What's that noise? Is there a bug in here? [sighs] I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Best night ever.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Glad you're rested up, because we've got a <i>long</i> trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls.
[eerie noises]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Yeah... Totally... [twitches]
<b>Rarity</b>: Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! <i>I think I'm sweating</i>!
 Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my 
little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier 
all the <i>time</i>!
<b>Applejack</b>: I don't care if that's cart's as heavy as a 
pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to
 the campsite!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride
 ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after
 dark, right?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Doesn't matter to me.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yawns]
[thump]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Don't fall asleep now... We've got to get to that campsite before dark... [snores, continues over]
[bonk]
<b>Crocodile</b>: [growls]
<b>Bear</b>: [licks lips] [chomps] [grunts]
<b>Rarity</b>: [fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes.
[twig snaps]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
[poof]
[crunch]
<b>Applejack</b>: You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh.
[owl hoots]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [yelps]
<b>Applejack</b>: You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh.
[frog croaking]
[bells ringing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Uh, d-do you need a little help?
<b>Rarity</b>: That's so sweet, thank you.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Um... what are friends for? [sounds of exertion]
[cart creaking]
<b>Applejack</b>: No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: All <i>right</i>! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course...
[wolf howling]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Thanks.
[creatures growling]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do 
this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three! 
[trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches...
<b>Applejack</b>: Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [panicked laughing] Here you go!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's <i>it</i>?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!
<b>Applejack</b>: It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
[fire starts]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Now, where was I? Oh yeah, the [spookily] scary part. [laughs evilly]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: There once was a really really nice pony who 
lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, 
and lots and lots of happy friends, and–
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: No offense, but it's not a real campfire 
story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these 
very woods are haunted...
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gulps]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [spookily] ...by The <i>Headless Horse</i>! It gallops only at night–
<b>Applejack</b>: If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: It's headless, not <i>brainless</i>. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies–
<b>Applejack</b>: So where's its brain?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Ugh. [spookily] Fear was dripping from the air...[crossfades out]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [spookily] [crossfades in] ...and they were never heard from ever again!
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [gasps] Never?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: <i>Never</i>.
[fire sparks]
<b>Apple Bloom</b> and <b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [screaming] [laughing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [trembling]
<b>Rarity</b>: Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: It's not time for bed yet, is it?
<b>Applejack</b>: 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet! [squeak]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: You don't have to ask me twice!
[thud]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: [out of rhythm and out of tune] 
Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall, ninety-nine buckets of oats! 
Take one down, [crossfades] pass it around, you got eighty-one buckets 
of oats on the wall, [crossfades] forty-one buckets of oats! Take one 
down, pass it around you got forty [pauses] buckets of oats on the wall!
 [crossfades] ...buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around, you've 
got zero buckets of oats on the <i>waaaaaaaalllllll</i>!!!! [snores]
<b>Other ponies</b>: [yawning]
<b>Rarity</b>: Good night, Sweetie Belle.
<b>Applejack</b>: Good night, y'all.
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: Good night, y'all.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sleep tight.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, just one more song! Anyone? [whoosh] How 
about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we 
mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with
 me?
<b>Apple Bloom</b>: [yawns] Maybe tomorrow.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Aww.
<b>Applejack</b>: Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Pfft, of course not! I just <i>love</i> 
camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna 
waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Ugh, this is so unfair... [yawns] I'm falling asleep... [snores]
[water dripping]
[hoofsteps]
[hoofsteps increase speed]
[vehicle accelerating]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And <i>I wanna be heard from</i>! Woah, woaaah! Ugh! [grunts] Woah!
[running hoofsteps]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: It's all over! [cries hysterically]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [panting] Aaah!
<b>Princess Luna</b>: [echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.
[poof]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!
<b>Princess Luna</b>: You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?
<b>Princess Luna</b>: I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!
[reverberating drumbeat]
<b>Princess Luna</b>: I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?
<b>Princess Luna</b>: Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse <i>really</i> what frightens you the most?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: <i>Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way.</i> But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [nervous whine]
[rocks tumbling]
<b>Princess Luna</b>: <i>Face your fears</i>!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: –Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.
[water dripping]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives <i>here</i>, in <i>these very woods</i>!
[distant whinnying]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse! [wings motoring]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: [whinny-like snoring]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [panting] So it's a horse without a head... 
which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, 
then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a 
horse <i>without a head</i>!
[tires screeching]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Whoa, whoa! [whining]
[river rushing]
[splash]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?
[branch cracking]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Heellllp–
[splash]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [gasps for breath]
[splashing]
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [screams, fades out]
[whoosh]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: I gotcha!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!
<b>Princess Luna</b>: [echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sighs] I'm so, so sorry, Rainbow Dash! I 
just wanted you to hang out with me and see how cool I was so you'd take
 me under your wing, teach me everything you know, and become like my 
big sister! [takes breath] But then you started telling those spooky 
stories and I got scared! I thought I heard The Headless Horse so I ran 
out here by myself, and... [crying] ...well, I guess you know the rest. 
[sniffling]
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if 
you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those 
stories... I was scared too.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [sniffles] You were?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there <i>was</i> such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: Mm-hmm.
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Yeah, I might be up for something like that.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: <i>Really</i>?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [giggles] It's a deal!
[waterfalls rushing]
<b>Sweetie Belle</b>: I call sister teams! Last herd to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!
<b>Rarity</b>: Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: They think <i>they</i> can beat the two of <i>us</i>?
<b>Scootaloo</b>: [wings fluttering]
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: [grumbling] <i>Who's got my rusty horseshoe</i>?
<b>Rainbow Dash</b>: Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning.
<b>The Olden Pony</b>: Thank you, and have a nice day.
<b>Princess Luna</b>: [chuckles]
